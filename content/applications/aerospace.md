# Aerospace Display Solutions

US Micro Products engineers display solutions for aerospace OEMs manufacturing avionics systems, flight deck instruments, cabin management displays, ground support equipment, and unmanned aerial systems. Our aerospace displays are deployed in programs for Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, and numerous defense and commercial aviation contractors.

Aerospace environments combine extreme temperatures, altitude pressure changes, vibration, solar radiation, and stringent reliability requirements with the absolute imperative that displays remain readable and functional throughout every phase of flight.

## Aerospace Display Requirements

### Environmental Extremes

**Temperature range.** Cockpit and external avionics face -55°C to +85°C temperature extremes. Ground-level tarmac heat, high-altitude cold, and rapid thermal transitions during climb and descent stress display materials, backlights, and LC fluid response. Our wide-temperature display solutions maintain full functionality across this range with heater circuits for cold-start conditions and thermally stable backlight assemblies.

**Altitude and pressure.** Unpressurized compartments at 40,000+ feet experience atmospheric pressures below 200 mbar. Optical bonding eliminates air gaps that could cause delamination, bubble formation, or optical distortion at low pressure. Sealed assemblies prevent condensation during rapid pressure and temperature transitions.

**Vibration.** Aircraft engines, propellers, rotorcraft rotors, and aerodynamic turbulence generate continuous vibrational loading. Bonded display assemblies, strain-relieved FPC connections, and reinforced mounting provisions ensure sustained performance under vibration profiles per RTCA DO-160 Category S through U.

**Solar radiation.** Cockpit displays face direct solar loading through transparent canopies. High-brightness backlights (1,000-2,500 nits), anti-reflective coatings, and optical bonding maintain readability. Displays must also resist UV degradation of polarizers, adhesives, and cover materials over 20+ year service lives.

### DO-160 Environmental Testing

RTCA DO-160, "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment," defines the qualification test standards for avionics displays. Key sections relevant to display assemblies include:

- **Section 4** — Temperature and altitude
- **Section 5** — Temperature variation
- **Section 7** — Operational shock and crash safety
- **Section 8** — Vibration
- **Section 14** — Humidity
- **Section 15** — Sand, dust, and fungus
- **Section 16** — Hydraulic fluid contamination
- **Section 21** — Emission of radio frequency energy (EMI)
- **Section 22** — Susceptibility to radio frequency energy

US Micro Products designs display assemblies to support your system-level DO-160 qualification. We provide test samples, support test plan development, and supply the documentation needed for certification submissions.

### Weight Optimization

Every gram matters in aerospace design. Display assemblies contribute to overall aircraft weight, fuel consumption, and payload capacity. Our aerospace display engineering considers:

- Thin-profile panels to minimize stack depth and weight
- Lightweight cover glass options (thin chemically-strengthened glass, polymer substrates)
- Compact backlight assemblies with efficient LED arrays
- Minimized bezel and mounting hardware weight
- Optimized FPC routing and connector selection

### Sunlight Readability

Cockpit displays must be readable in direct sunlight with solar illumination exceeding 10,000 lux. Our aerospace display solutions achieve sunlight readability through:

- High-brightness backlights (1,500-2,500 nits)
- Optical bonding (40%+ reflection reduction)
- Circular polarizer or AR-coated cover glass
- High-contrast panel technology (IPS or MVA)
- Anti-glare surface treatment where appropriate

### NVIS Compatibility

Many military and some commercial aerospace applications require NVIS (Night Vision Imaging System) compatibility per MIL-STD-3009. See our [military display solutions](/applications/military) page for detailed NVIS requirements. We provide NVIS Green A, Green B, and White configurations with dual-mode day/night operation.
