# Medical Display Solutions

US Micro Products engineers display solutions for medical device OEMs manufacturing surgical equipment, patient monitors, diagnostic instruments, portable point-of-care devices, and medical wearables. Our displays are deployed in products from GE Healthcare, Philips, Siemens, Abbott, and hundreds of medical device companies worldwide — from FDA-cleared Class II devices to CE-marked diagnostic systems.

The medical display market demands the highest standards for image quality, reliability, safety, and regulatory compliance. A display failure in a surgical environment or a misread value on a patient monitor carries consequences beyond the commercial — it affects patient outcomes. US Micro Products treats this responsibility with the engineering rigor it demands.

## Medical Display Requirements

### Image Quality and Accuracy

Medical displays must render clinical data with precision. Key optical parameters include:

**Color accuracy.** Diagnostic imaging, surgical camera feeds, and patient vitals dashboards require consistent, accurate color rendering. IPS TFT panels with wide color gamut (sRGB or DCI-P3 coverage) and factory-calibrated uniformity ensure that what the clinician sees matches the clinical data.

**High resolution.** Surgical displays and diagnostic imaging demand pixel densities sufficient for fine detail — 1920×1080 minimum for primary surgical monitors, with 4K available for emerging endoscopic and microscopic visualization systems. Patient monitors and bedside terminals typically operate at 1024×600 or 1280×800.

**Wide viewing angles.** Operating rooms, ICU bays, and patient rooms have multiple staff viewing displays simultaneously from different positions. IPS panels with 170°+ viewing angles in all directions ensure consistent readings regardless of the clinician's position.

**High brightness and contrast.** Surgical environments may use bright overhead lighting, while reading rooms require precise low-luminance rendering. Our medical displays support brightness ranges from 300 nits (reading room compatible) to 1,500+ nits (high-ambient surgical environments), with contrast ratios exceeding 1,000:1.

### Safety and Biocompatibility

**Antimicrobial surfaces.** Hospital-acquired infections are a critical concern. Our medical displays incorporate antimicrobial cover glass treatments — silver ion technology and copper-based coatings — that continuously reduce microbial load on the display surface. These treatments are effective against MRSA, E. coli, and other common healthcare-associated pathogens.

**Chemical resistance.** Medical displays must withstand repeated cleaning with hospital-grade disinfectants including bleach solutions, quaternary ammonium compounds, and alcohol-based cleaners. Our cover glass and bonding materials are validated against accelerated aging protocols simulating years of cleaning cycles.

**Sealed and cleanable.** Flush-mounted, optically bonded displays with no crevices or air gaps prevent fluid ingress and biofilm formation. Sealed assemblies rated to IP65 or higher withstand splash-down cleaning procedures.

### Touch in Clinical Environments

Medical touch displays must function reliably with gloved hands — surgical latex, nitrile examination gloves, and sterile double-glove setups. Our [PCAP touch panels](/products/touch-panels) support configurable glove-mode sensitivity profiles that maintain accurate touch detection through up to 3 mm of glove material.

Additional medical touch requirements:
- **Palm rejection** — Prevent accidental inputs from resting hands during procedures
- **Wet-touch rejection** — Distinguish between disinfectant sprayed on the screen and intentional touches
- **Antimicrobial cover glass** — Continuous surface disinfection between manual cleaning
- **Easy-clean oleophobic coating** — Reduces smudge adhesion for cleaner, more readable displays

### Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

While US Micro Products is a component supplier (not a medical device manufacturer), we design our display solutions to support your regulatory pathway:

**IEC 60601 compatibility.** Our display assemblies can be designed with EMI shielding, grounding, and isolation features that support your system-level IEC 60601-1 (electrical safety) and IEC 60601-1-2 (EMC) compliance.

**Biocompatibility.** Cover glass materials, adhesives, and coatings can be selected from biocompatible options with supporting documentation for ISO 10993 evaluation.

**Quality system.** US Micro Products is ISO 9001 certified. Our quality management system, documentation practices, and traceability support medical device manufacturer requirements for supplier qualification.

**Design documentation.** We provide complete design documentation including material specifications, test reports, and change management procedures compatible with FDA Design Controls (21 CFR 820) and EU MDR requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are your displays FDA cleared?
US Micro Products supplies display components, not finished medical devices. Our displays are designed to support your medical device's FDA 510(k) or PMA regulatory submission. We provide the design documentation, test data, and material certifications needed for your regulatory filing.

### Can your displays withstand hospital disinfectants?
Yes. Our medical display assemblies are validated against common healthcare disinfectants including 10% bleach solution, 70% IPA, quaternary ammonium compounds, and hydrogen peroxide wipes. Optical bonding and sealed cover glass construction prevent fluid ingress.

### What is your minimum order quantity for medical displays?
MOQs vary by customization level. Catalog modifications (bonding, cover glass, touch) start at 100-500 units. We work with medical device companies at all stages — from prototype quantities during design verification through volume production.

### How do you handle component obsolescence for medical products?
Medical device lifecycles often exceed 10 years. We proactively monitor EOL notices, maintain safety stock programs, offer last-time-buy support, and engineer replacement solutions when panels or components are discontinued. See our [EOL parts support](/support/eol-parts) page.
