# Gaming & Casino Display Solutions

US Micro Products engineers display solutions for gaming industry OEMs manufacturing slot machines, video poker terminals, sports betting kiosks, player tracking systems, casino signage, and arcade cabinets. Gaming displays operate 24/7/365 in demanding casino floor environments where brightness, reliability, and visual impact directly affect player engagement and revenue.

## Gaming Display Requirements

### 24/7 Operation and Reliability

Casino gaming equipment operates continuously — 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Displays must maintain image quality, brightness, and color accuracy over operational lifetimes exceeding 50,000 hours. Key reliability considerations include:

**LED backlight longevity.** Backlight assemblies must maintain at least 70% of initial brightness (L70) after 50,000 hours. Our gaming displays use high-reliability LED arrays with thermal management designed for continuous operation.

**Burn-in mitigation.** Static game elements (bet buttons, credit displays, brand logos) can cause image retention on LCDs and burn-in on OLEDs. IPS and MVA TFT panels with periodic pixel-shifting algorithms minimize retention. For OLED-based gaming displays, we implement content-aware burn-in prevention strategies.

**Component reliability.** Driver boards, power supplies, and cable assemblies are selected and qualified for continuous operation at elevated ambient temperatures typical of casino machine cabinets (35-45°C internal).

### Brightness and Viewing Angles

Casino floors are brightly lit environments designed to keep players engaged. Displays compete with overhead lighting, adjacent machine lighting, and ambient reflections. Gaming displays require:

- **High brightness** — 500 to 1,500 nits depending on position (top box signage vs. primary game display)
- **Wide viewing angles** — IPS panels with 170°+ viewing angles ensure the game is attractive from approach angles, drawing players from across the floor
- **High contrast** — Deep blacks and vivid colors enhance game graphics and create visual impact
- **Anti-reflective treatment** — Reduce reflections from overhead casino lighting

### Size Range

Modern gaming machines use multiple displays in various positions:

- **Primary game display** — 22" to 32" TFT LCD for the main game screen
- **Top box** — 22" to 43" for bonus content, progressive jackpot displays, and brand signage
- **Button deck / bet panel** — 10" to 15" with PCAP touch for player controls
- **Player tracking** — 7" to 10" with touch for player card display, messaging, and rewards
- **Signage and progressive** — 43" to 85"+ for overhead jackpot displays and casino signage

### Touch for Gaming

Gaming touch displays require high durability and consistent performance under heavy use:

- **PCAP touch** — [Projected capacitive touch panels](/products/touch-panels) for button deck and player tracking displays
- **Vandal-resistant cover glass** — 6-8 mm chemically strengthened glass for player-facing surfaces
- **High touch durability** — Rated for millions of touch events without degradation
- **Multi-touch** — Support for gesture-based game interactions
- **Easy cleaning** — Oleophobic coating to reduce fingerprint visibility

### Regulatory Compliance

Gaming displays must support compliance with jurisdictional gaming regulations:

- **Color accuracy** — Consistent color rendering to ensure game artwork meets regulatory approval specifications
- **Brightness uniformity** — Even illumination across the display area for regulatory game testing
- **Electromagnetic compatibility** — EMI levels that don't interfere with gaming board testing equipment or casino surveillance systems
