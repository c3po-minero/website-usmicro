# Marine Display Solutions

US Micro Products engineers display solutions for marine electronics manufacturers building navigation systems, fish finders, engine monitoring interfaces, helm displays, radar screens, and onboard entertainment systems. Our displays operate in the punishing marine environment — continuous salt spray exposure, direct sunlight, wide temperature swings, constant vibration, and moisture infiltration that rapidly degrades consumer-grade components.

Marine electronics must function flawlessly when it matters most. A navigation display that washes out in direct sunlight, a depth sounder readout that fails in a salt-air environment, or an engine management screen that cracks under hull vibration puts crew and passengers at risk. US Micro Products builds marine display solutions engineered for the realities of life on the water.

## Marine Display Requirements

### Sunlight Readability

Marine displays face some of the harshest optical environments in any industry. Open water amplifies sunlight through direct exposure and surface reflections — effective ambient brightness can exceed 100,000 lux.

**High brightness backlights.** Standard 300-500 nit displays are unreadable in direct sunlight. Our marine display solutions deliver 1,000 to 2,500 nits of sustained brightness, ensuring helm and navigation displays remain readable in full-sun conditions at any heading.

**Optical bonding.** Laminating the LCD panel directly to the cover glass eliminates the internal air gap present in standard display assemblies. This eliminates internal reflections, increases effective contrast by up to 400%, and dramatically improves sunlight readability. Optical bonding also strengthens the display assembly mechanically — critical in high-vibration marine environments.

**Anti-reflective and anti-glare coatings.** AR coatings reduce surface reflections to below 0.5%, while AG treatments diffuse reflected light. The correct choice depends on the installation — recessed helm-mounted displays benefit most from AR coatings, while exposed flybridge displays often perform better with AG treatments that handle multi-directional reflections.

### Salt Spray and Corrosion Resistance

Salt spray is the defining environmental challenge in marine electronics. Salt deposits are hygroscopic, conductive, and corrosive — they attract moisture, create electrical paths that shouldn't exist, and eat through unprotected metals and coatings.

**Sealed assemblies.** Our marine displays are designed as sealed units — optically bonded, gasket-sealed, and rated to IP66 or IP67. No air gaps, no crevices where salt deposits accumulate, no paths for salt-laden moisture to reach electronics.

**Corrosion-resistant materials.** Stainless steel mounting hardware, marine-grade aluminum bezels, and corrosion-resistant connector systems prevent the degradation that occurs when standard materials meet salt air. FPC connections are conformal coated and strain-relieved.

**Salt fog testing.** We validate marine display assemblies against accelerated salt fog testing protocols (per MIL-STD-810 Method 509 or equivalent), simulating years of marine exposure to verify seal integrity and material durability before production.

### Temperature and Humidity

Marine operating environments span from freezing northern waters to tropical equatorial conditions — often within a single vessel's operating range.

**Wide operating temperature.** Our marine displays operate from -30°C to 80°C, covering everything from arctic fishing vessel instrumentation to engine room monitoring in tropical environments. Extended temperature versions with heater circuits enable reliable cold-start operation in sub-zero conditions.

**Humidity resistance.** Sustained 95%+ relative humidity is normal in marine environments. Optical bonding eliminates internal condensation (the fogging effect that destroys standard displays in marine use). Conformal coatings on electronics provide additional moisture protection.

### Vibration and Shock

Hull-transmitted engine vibration, wave impact, and operational handling subject marine displays to continuous mechanical stress.

**Vibration-resistant construction.** Optically bonded display assemblies are inherently more vibration-resistant than air-gap designs — the bonded stack functions as a single rigid unit rather than separate vibrating layers. Reinforced mounting provisions and strain-relieved cable connections complete the mechanical design.

**Shock tolerance.** Wave slam events can generate transient shock loads of 20g or more. Our marine display assemblies are designed to withstand these events without display damage, bonding failure, or connector disconnection.

### Viewing Angles

Helm displays, overhead chart plotters, and cockpit instruments are viewed from a wide range of angles as crew move around the vessel.

**IPS panels.** We specify IPS (In-Plane Switching) TFT panels for marine applications — delivering 170°+ viewing angles in all directions with minimal color shift and contrast degradation. This ensures accurate navigation data and engine readings regardless of the operator's position relative to the display.

## Marine Standards and Certifications

Marine electronics operate under regulatory frameworks that vary by vessel type and region:

- **IEC 60945** — Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment, general requirements for shipborne equipment including environmental testing (temperature, humidity, vibration, salt mist)
- **IEC 62288** — Presentation of navigation-related information on shipborne displays
- **DNV GL / Lloyd's / ABS type approval** — Classification society requirements for commercial vessel equipment
- **NMEA 2000 / NMEA 0183** — Marine data communication standards for instrument networking
- **IP66/IP67** — Ingress protection ratings for water spray and immersion exposure typical in marine installations

## Case Study: Commercial Navigation System

A leading marine electronics manufacturer needed to replace an aging 12" navigation display used across their product line of chart plotters and multifunction displays. The replacement required 1,500-nit sustained brightness for tropical exposed-helm use, IP67 sealing, salt fog resistance per IEC 60945, and backward-compatible mechanical mounting.

US Micro Products engineered a custom 12.1" IPS TFT assembly with optical bonding, high-brightness LED backlight with constant-current dimming (supporting both daylight and night-vision-compatible low-brightness modes), AR-coated chemically strengthened cover glass, and a marine-grade aluminum bezel with integrated gasket sealing. The assembly passed IEC 60945 environmental qualification including temperature cycling (-25°C to 55°C), salt mist (per IEC 60068-2-52), and vibration testing.

Production ramped within 14 weeks of design approval. The display is now deployed across three product generations with zero field failures attributed to the display assembly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What brightness level is required for marine displays?
For exposed-helm installations in direct sunlight, we recommend 1,000 nits minimum, with 1,500-2,500 nits preferred for tropical and equatorial operation. Cabin-mounted displays typically perform well at 500-700 nits. Optical bonding and AR coatings significantly improve effective readability at any brightness level.

### How do you prevent condensation inside marine displays?
Optical bonding eliminates the internal air gap where condensation forms in standard displays. The bonded assembly is a solid optical stack with no internal surfaces for moisture to condense on. This is the single most important design decision for marine display reliability.

### What IP rating should a marine display have?
IP66 (powerful water jets) is the minimum for exposed installations. IP67 (temporary immersion) provides additional margin for cockpit-mounted displays that may be submerged during heavy weather. Cabin-mounted displays can operate at IP54 or higher.

### Can marine displays operate in both daylight and night conditions?
Yes. Our marine displays support wide dimming ranges — from 2,500 nits for full sunlight down to below 1 nit for night-watch operation. NVIS-compatible dimming modes are available for military and commercial navigation applications.

### Do you support NMEA 2000 integration?
Our [smart display modules](/products/smart-displays) can interface with NMEA 2000 networks via gateway modules. For dedicated NMEA integration, our engineering team works with your system architects to specify the appropriate interface and protocol handling.
