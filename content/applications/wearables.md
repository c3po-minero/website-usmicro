# Wearable Display Solutions

US Micro Products is the #1 provider of displays for the wearable market. We have engineered and delivered millions of wearable display solutions for smartwatches, fitness trackers, medical wearables, smart rings, hearables, and body-worn sensors. Our deep expertise in AMOLED and PMOLED technologies, combined with our custom engineering capabilities, makes us the partner of choice for wearable OEMs demanding premium visual quality in ultra-compact, power-efficient packages.

## Why Wearable Displays Are Different

Wearable products impose engineering constraints that don't exist in other display applications:

### Ultra-Compact Form Factor
Wearable displays typically range from 0.49" to 1.6" diagonal — the smallest display sizes in production. At this scale, every tenth of a millimeter in stack height, every milligram of weight, and every square millimeter of active area matters. Display assembly design must account for:

- Total stack height under 2 mm (display + touch + cover glass)
- FPC routing in confined, curved enclosures
- Minimal non-active bezel area to maximize screen-to-body ratio
- Weight impact on user comfort for all-day wear

### Power Budget
Wearable devices operate on batteries measured in hundreds of milliamp-hours — typically 200-400 mAh for smartwatches, 50-150 mAh for fitness bands. The display is often the single largest power consumer. Display technology selection directly determines whether the device lasts one day or seven:

**AMOLED for wearables.** AMOLED panels consume zero power for black pixels. With dark-themed UIs, always-on display modes show time and notifications using only the lit pixels — dramatically extending battery life. A well-designed AMOLED always-on display can consume under 5 mW.

**PMOLED for ultra-low power.** For simple displays (step count, heart rate, time), PMOLED panels offer even lower system-level power consumption than AMOLED because they eliminate the active-matrix TFT backplane. Typical PMOLED wearable displays consume 10-30 mW during active use.

### Outdoor Readability
Wearable displays are viewed in uncontrolled lighting — bright sunlight during outdoor exercise, dim indoor environments, nighttime runs. Displays must be readable across this full range:

- High peak brightness (600+ nits for AMOLED)
- Excellent contrast ratio (infinite for OLED, essential for sunlight readability)
- Auto-brightness via ambient light sensor integration
- Anti-reflective cover glass or lens

### Durability and Water Resistance
Wearable devices are subjected to impacts, scratches, sweat, rain, swimming, and daily wear that would damage unprotected displays. Our wearable display assemblies incorporate:

- Chemically strengthened cover glass (Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail, sapphire)
- Full optical lamination (impact resistance, no moisture ingress at bonding)
- IP67/IP68 rated assembly design
- Sweat and saltwater resistant materials and adhesives

### Round and Non-Standard Shapes
Wearable products — especially smartwatches — frequently require round or non-rectangular displays. Our portfolio includes:

- Full-circle round AMOLED displays (no flat-tire)
- Flat-tire round displays (compact driver IC mounting)
- Curved/2.5D cover glass for wraparound aesthetics
- Flexible AMOLED for curved band-mounted displays

## Our Wearable Expertise

**Market leadership.** Our position as the #1 wearable display provider is built on thousands of wearable display designs shipped to customers worldwide. We've solved problems most display companies haven't encountered — curved FPC routing in 8 mm watch cases, waterproof bonding at 5 ATM pressure, power optimization strategies that extend battery life by days.

**Panel access.** Direct relationships with AMOLED and PMOLED panel manufacturers give us access to the latest wearable-specific panels — high-PPI round displays, flexible substrates, under-display sensors — often before they're available through any other channel.

**Full assembly capability.** We deliver complete wearable display assemblies — panel + touch + cover glass + bonding + FPC — tested, inspected, and ready for integration into your enclosure. One part number, one supplier, one quality standard.

**Volume experience.** From initial prototypes of 50 units to production runs of millions, our [manufacturing](/services/ems) and [logistics](/services/logistics) infrastructure scales to wearable market volumes.
