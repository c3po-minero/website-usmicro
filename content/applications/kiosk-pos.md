# Kiosk & POS Display Solutions

US Micro Products engineers display solutions for self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, interactive wayfinding, digital signage, ATMs, ticketing machines, and public-access information systems. Kiosk and POS displays face a unique combination of requirements: 24/7 operation, heavy public use, vandal resistance, environmental exposure, and the need to engage users through bright, responsive touch interfaces.

## Kiosk & POS Display Requirements

### Durability and Vandal Resistance

Public-facing displays endure constant physical interaction — finger taps, palm presses, accidental impacts, and deliberate abuse. The display must survive:

**Thick cover glass.** Chemically strengthened glass in 4-8 mm thickness protects the underlying touch sensor and LCD. Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail, and Schott Xensation provide impact resistance ratings that withstand the daily reality of public use.

**Surface hardness.** Cover glass surface hardness of 7H-9H (Mohs scale) resists scratching from keys, coins, rings, and abrasive cleaning tools.

**Sealed construction.** Optically bonded, gasket-sealed assemblies prevent liquid ingress from spilled drinks, cleaning fluids, rain (outdoor kiosks), and deliberate tampering.

**Anti-vandal mounting.** Security-fastened bezels and tamper-resistant hardware prevent unauthorized removal or disassembly.

### Touch Performance

Kiosk touch interfaces must be responsive, accurate, and intuitive for users of all ages and abilities:

- **[PCAP multi-touch](/products/touch-panels)** — Projected capacitive touch through thick cover glass for responsive, durable interaction
- **All-user accessibility** — Touch targets sized for ADA compliance, operable by users with limited dexterity
- **Glove mode** — For outdoor kiosks and cold-climate installations
- **Anti-microbial cover glass** — Continuous surface disinfection for healthcare facility kiosks, food service ordering, and high-traffic public installations
- **Water rejection** — For outdoor kiosks exposed to rain and condensation

### Brightness and Readability

**Indoor kiosks.** Standard brightness of 350-700 nits handles typical retail and lobby lighting.

**Semi-outdoor kiosks.** Window-adjacent, covered outdoor, and drive-through installations require 1,000+ nits to compete with ambient daylight.

**Outdoor kiosks.** Direct sunlight exposure demands 1,500-2,500+ nits combined with optical bonding, AR coating, and auto-brightness control. See our [harsh environments](/applications/harsh-environments) page.

### 24/7 Reliability

Kiosks and POS terminals operate continuously in retail, hospitality, healthcare, and transportation environments:

- LED backlights rated for 50,000+ hour L70 lifespan
- Thermally managed backlight drivers for sustained high-brightness operation
- Wide operating temperature range for outdoor and semi-outdoor installations
- Redundant touch controller firmware for unattended operation reliability
