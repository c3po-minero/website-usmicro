# Military Display Solutions

US Micro Products has supplied ruggedized display solutions to the defense industry since our founding. Our military displays are deployed in ground vehicles, aircraft cockpits, naval vessels, portable field equipment, and command-and-control systems for defense OEMs including Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, and numerous prime and sub-tier defense contractors.

Military display applications impose the most demanding environmental, optical, and reliability requirements of any industry. Every design decision — panel selection, backlight architecture, bonding method, material choice — must account for extreme temperatures, mechanical shock, vibration, humidity, altitude, EMI, and operational security requirements that far exceed commercial specifications.

## MIL-STD Environmental Requirements

### MIL-STD-810 — Environmental Engineering

MIL-STD-810 defines test methods and conditions for equipment exposed to the natural and induced environments encountered during military service. Key display-relevant tests include:

**Temperature.** Operating ranges from -46°C to +71°C (storage to -62°C to +85°C). Displays must start, operate, and remain readable across this full range. Our solutions incorporate wide-temperature LC formulations, heater circuits for cold-start operation, and thermally stable backlight assemblies.

**Shock.** Functional requirements after mechanical shock events — transit drop, ballistic shock, crash safety, and operational impacts. Optical bonding significantly improves shock resistance by eliminating the air gap where panel-to-glass impacts occur.

**Vibration.** Continuous vibrational loading from vehicle engines, rotorcraft, and tracked vehicles. Our bonded display assemblies withstand sustained vibration profiles without image degradation, connector loosening, or structural failure.

**Humidity.** Exposure to 95%+ relative humidity, including condensation and salt fog. Conformal coatings, sealed assemblies, and corrosion-resistant materials protect display electronics and optical surfaces.

**Sand and dust.** Fine particle exposure per MIL-STD-810 Method 510. Sealed display assemblies rated to IP6X prevent particle ingress that degrades optical performance and accelerates component wear.

**Altitude.** Operation at altitudes up to 40,000 feet (12,200 m) with corresponding low atmospheric pressure. Display assemblies must not delaminate, leak, or exhibit pressure-related optical distortion.

### MIL-STD-461 — EMI/EMC

Electromagnetic interference requirements for military equipment. Display assemblies for defense applications incorporate:

- EMI-shielded enclosures and bezels
- Conductive coatings on cover glass (ITO mesh or metal mesh)
- Filtered connectors and shielded FPCs
- Grounding provisions for system-level EMC compliance
- Conducted and radiated emissions control per CE101, CE102, RE101, RE102
- Susceptibility testing per CS101, CS114, RS103

### MIL-STD-3009 — NVIS Compatibility

Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) compatibility requires displays to emit no energy in the near-infrared spectrum (wavelengths above ~625 nm) that would interfere with night vision goggles. This requires:

**NVIS-compatible backlights.** Standard white LED backlights emit significant near-IR energy. NVIS-compatible backlights use filtered or spectrally optimized LEDs that eliminate IR emission while maintaining sufficient visible-light output for daytime readability.

**NVIS filters.** Optical bandpass filters mounted in front of the LCD panel block IR transmission while passing visible wavelengths. Available in NVIS Green A, NVIS Green B, and NVIS White Type I/II configurations per MIL-STD-3009.

**Dual-mode operation.** Many military displays require both high-brightness daytime operation (1,000+ nits) and NVIS-compatible nighttime operation. Our designs implement switchable backlight modes and filter configurations for seamless day/night transitions.

## Ruggedization Solutions

### Optical Bonding
The single most impactful upgrade for military display reliability. Optical bonding fills the air gap between cover glass and LCD with a UV-cured optical adhesive, providing:

- 400%+ improvement in contrast ratio (reduced internal reflections)
- Significant improvement in shock and vibration resistance (bonded glass absorbs impacts)
- Elimination of condensation between glass and LCD
- Improved sunlight readability (reduced reflection surfaces)

### Sunlight Readability
Military personnel operate in uncontrolled lighting environments — from bright desert sunlight to dark vehicle interiors. Our solutions combine:

- High-brightness backlights (1,000–2,500 nits)
- Optical bonding (reflection reduction)
- Anti-reflective coatings (surface reflection control)
- High contrast LCD panels (IPS or MVA)
- Transflective modes where applicable

### Environmental Sealing
Display assemblies can be sealed to IP67 or higher with:

- Gasket-sealed bezels
- Hermetically sealed connectors
- Conformal-coated electronics
- Bonded optical stacks (no internal air gaps to trap moisture)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you supply ITAR-controlled displays?
US Micro Products supplies COTS and modified-COTS display components that are typically not ITAR-controlled. However, custom designs developed under ITAR-controlled programs are handled with appropriate access controls and documentation. Contact us to discuss your specific program requirements.

### What is the typical qualification timeline for a military display?
Qualification timelines depend on the applicable MIL-STD requirements and your program's test plan. Prototype delivery is typically 8-16 weeks. First Article qualification testing typically requires an additional 8-16 weeks. We provide the test samples, documentation, and engineering support needed throughout qualification.

### Do you stock military-grade displays?
We maintain safety stock and buffer inventory for active military programs. For new programs, lead times follow our standard custom display process. We also offer [inventory management](/services/inventory-management) programs specifically designed for defense program demand patterns.
