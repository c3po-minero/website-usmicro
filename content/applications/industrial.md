# Industrial Display Solutions

US Micro Products engineers display solutions for industrial OEMs manufacturing factory automation systems, process control equipment, CNC machines, test and measurement instruments, building automation panels, and ruggedized field equipment. Industrial displays must perform reliably in environments that include temperature extremes, dust, moisture, vibration, chemical exposure, and continuous operation — conditions that destroy consumer-grade displays.

## Industrial Display Requirements

### Environmental Durability

**Temperature range.** Factory floors, outdoor enclosures, and process environments expose displays to wide temperature swings. Standard industrial displays operate from -20°C to 70°C; extended-range versions cover -40°C to 85°C for outdoor and unheated enclosure installations. Heater circuits enable cold-start operation in freezer and cold-storage environments.

**Dust and moisture.** IP-rated sealing protects displays from particulate contamination, water spray, and washdown procedures. Sealed, optically bonded display assemblies eliminate internal air gaps where moisture and particles accumulate. We design display assemblies supporting IP54 through IP67 sealing at the display bezel.

**Chemical resistance.** Industrial cleaning agents, lubricants, coolants, and process chemicals contact display surfaces in manufacturing environments. Our cover glass materials and bonding adhesives are validated against common industrial chemicals.

**Vibration and shock.** Machinery vibration, forklift impact, and operational handling stress display assemblies continuously. Optically bonded displays with reinforced mounting and strain-relieved FPC connections withstand industrial vibration profiles.

### HMI Integration

Industrial displays frequently serve as Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) — the primary interaction point between operators and automated systems. HMI display requirements include:

**Touch interaction.** [PCAP touch panels](/products/touch-panels) with glove-mode support for operators wearing work gloves. Wet-finger rejection for environments with coolants or cleaning fluids. Multi-touch for gesture-based controls and navigation.

**Readability.** High brightness (500-1,000+ nits) and wide viewing angles (IPS) ensure operators can read critical data from various positions on the factory floor. Anti-glare coatings reduce reflections from overhead lighting.

**Responsiveness.** Fast LCD response times and low-latency touch processing ensure operators receive immediate visual and tactile feedback when interacting with machine controls.

**Communication protocols.** [Smart display modules](/products/smart-displays) with built-in controllers communicate via UART, SPI, or I2C — integrating directly with PLCs, industrial microcontrollers, and edge computing platforms common in automation systems.

### Long Lifecycle and Reliability

Industrial equipment lifecycles routinely exceed 10-15 years. Display component availability and consistency must match:

- **Lifecycle management** — We proactively manage panel EOL transitions, qualification of second sources, and last-time-buy programs
- **Configuration control** — Strict change management ensures form, fit, and function compatibility across production lots
- **Consistent quality** — ISO 9001 quality system with incoming inspection, lot traceability, and controlled processes

### Sunlight and Outdoor Readability

Displays mounted in outdoor enclosures, on vehicles, or in windowed buildings face direct and indirect sunlight. Our high-brightness industrial display solutions combine 1,000+ nit backlights, optical bonding, and AR coatings for full sunlight readability. See also [harsh environments](/applications/harsh-environments) for extreme outdoor requirements.
