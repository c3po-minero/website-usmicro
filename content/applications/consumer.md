# Consumer Electronics Displays

US Micro Products engineers display solutions for consumer electronics OEMs developing IoT devices, smart home products, portable electronics, audio equipment, personal care devices, and connected consumer appliances. Consumer products demand premium visual quality and appealing industrial design at competitive price points — a balance our engineering team achieves through technology selection, design optimization, and volume manufacturing efficiency.

## Consumer Display Requirements

### Design Aesthetics

Consumer products live in customers' homes and pockets. The display isn't just a functional component — it's a design element that shapes the product's perceived quality and brand identity.

**Thin bezels.** Modern consumer design language demands minimal non-display border. Our engineering team selects panels with narrow inactive borders and designs cover glass with edge-to-edge aesthetics using precisely printed decorative bezels.

**Premium surface finish.** 2.5D curved cover glass, oleophobic coatings, and high-quality surface treatments create the premium tactile and visual experience consumers expect from modern electronics.

**Color consistency.** Consumer products are displayed in retail environments and reviewed in online media. Display color accuracy and unit-to-unit consistency affect brand perception. Our IPS TFT and AMOLED panels provide the color accuracy and uniformity consumer brands require.

### Cost Optimization

Consumer electronics operate on thinner margins than industrial or defense products. Cost optimization spans the entire display supply chain:

- **Panel selection** — We source from multiple panel manufacturers to find the optimal balance of performance, availability, and cost for your volume
- **Design for manufacturing** — Minimizing assembly steps, optimizing material usage, and simplifying the display stack reduces per-unit cost
- **Volume pricing** — Our relationships with panel and component suppliers deliver competitive pricing at consumer volumes
- **Value engineering** — We identify specification areas where modest relaxation (e.g., viewing angle, operating temperature) can significantly reduce cost without affecting user experience

### Time to Market

Consumer product windows are measured in months, not years. Our streamlined EDSP process delivers:

- Specification review and technology recommendation within 1 week
- Prototype samples in 4-8 weeks for catalog modifications
- Production ramp in 4-6 weeks following prototype approval
- Parallel development of multiple variants when product lines share display platforms

### Power Efficiency

Battery-powered consumer devices — wearables, portable speakers, smart home remotes, personal health devices — require aggressive power management. Technology selection drives power efficiency:

- **AMOLED** — Zero power for black pixels, ideal for dark-themed UIs
- **PMOLED** — Ultra-low power for simple status displays
- **Reflective/transflective LCD** — Zero backlight power in well-lit environments
- **Backlight dimming** — PWM-controlled LED backlights that dim to near-zero in dark environments
