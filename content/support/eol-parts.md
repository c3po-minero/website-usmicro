# EOL & Obsolete Display Replacement

Display panels get discontinued. Factories close lines, consolidate products, or exit technologies entirely. When the display in your product goes end-of-life, you have a problem — and typically a tight timeline to solve it.

US Micro Products helps OEMs find, qualify, and transition to replacement displays when their current parts are discontinued. We've solved hundreds of EOL situations across every major display technology, and our global supply chain relationships give us visibility into replacement options that you won't find through a standard distribution search.

## The EOL Problem

When a display reaches end-of-life, the typical notification timeline gives you 6–12 months of last-time-buy opportunity. After that, you're out of stock and out of production. The challenges compound:

- **Your product is still selling.** EOL doesn't align with your product lifecycle — especially in medical, military, and industrial applications where product lifetimes are 7–15+ years.
- **Drop-in replacements are rare.** Even when a panel with similar specifications exists, differences in mechanical dimensions, pinout, timing, voltage levels, or optical characteristics mean it's not truly a drop-in.
- **Qualification takes time.** Switching displays in a qualified product — especially in regulated industries — requires engineering evaluation, testing, and potentially re-certification.
- **Your team is already busy.** An EOL display replacement is unplanned engineering work that competes with new product development for your team's time and attention.

## How We Help

### Cross-Reference Search

We maintain relationships with display manufacturers across China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. When your display goes EOL, we search our network for compatible replacements — including panels that may not appear in public catalogs or distributor inventories. Our engineers evaluate candidates against your original specification, not just the datasheet headline numbers.

### Compatibility Assessment

For each potential replacement, we provide a detailed compatibility assessment:

- **Mechanical fit** — Outline dimensions, mounting holes, connector position, viewing area, thickness
- **Electrical compatibility** — Interface type and timing, voltage levels, pinout, backlight driver requirements
- **Optical performance** — Brightness, contrast, color gamut, viewing angles compared to original
- **Environmental ratings** — Operating temperature, storage temperature, humidity, vibration
- **Touch compatibility** — If applicable, touch sensor dimensions, controller compatibility, and cover glass fitment

We identify the gaps — what matches, what's close, and what requires design changes on your end.

### Redesign Support

When no drop-in replacement exists, we engineer a solution:

- **Adapter boards** — Interface conversion or pinout adaptation to bridge differences between old and new panels
- **Mechanical adaptation** — Custom bezels, mounting brackets, or cover glass to accommodate dimensional differences
- **Optical matching** — Bonding, coatings, and backlight adjustments to match the original display's optical performance
- **Custom display design** — When the best path forward is a purpose-built replacement, we design it

### Last-Time-Buy Management

When EOL notice arrives, we help you calculate your last-time-buy quantity based on demand forecasts and transition timeline. We can hold safety stock in our facilities to extend your production runway while the replacement is qualified.

### Proactive Monitoring

For customers with active production programs, we monitor EOL notices and supply chain signals proactively. When we learn that a panel in your BOM is at risk, we notify you before it becomes an emergency — giving you maximum time to plan the transition.

## Industries We Support

EOL display replacement is particularly critical in:

- **[Medical devices](/applications/medical)** — FDA-cleared products with long lifecycles and change control requirements
- **[Military and aerospace](/applications/military)** — Qualified systems where component changes require re-testing and re-certification
- **[Industrial equipment](/applications/industrial)** — Production equipment and instruments with 10–20+ year operational lifetimes
- **[Transportation](/applications/transportation)** — Vehicles and infrastructure displays with long deployment cycles

## Get Help with an EOL Display

If you've received an EOL notice — or suspect your display supply is at risk — [contact us](/contact) with:

- Current display part number and manufacturer
- Datasheet or specification (if available)
- Annual usage quantity
- Remaining inventory or last-time-buy quantity
- Timeline pressure (how soon you need a replacement qualified)

We'll assess your situation and provide a recommended path forward, typically within a few business days.
