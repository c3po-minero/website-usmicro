# Request a Quote

Tell us about your display requirements and we'll respond with a detailed proposal — typically within 1–2 business days. The more information you can provide upfront, the faster and more accurate our initial response will be.

## What to Include in Your Request

### Basic Requirements

- **Display size** — Diagonal measurement or active area dimensions
- **Resolution** — Pixel count or minimum resolution requirements
- **Interface** — MIPI, LVDS, eDP, RGB, SPI, HDMI, or other. If you're unsure, tell us what processor or controller you're using and we'll recommend an interface.
- **Quantity** — Annual volume estimate and initial order quantity. Even a rough estimate helps us recommend the right approach (catalog, modified, or custom).

### Application Context

- **What is the product?** — Understanding your application helps us recommend the right technology, environmental ratings, and configuration. A medical patient monitor has different requirements than an outdoor kiosk or a marine navigation display.
- **Operating environment** — Temperature range, indoor/outdoor, ambient light conditions, humidity, vibration, or other environmental factors.
- **Regulatory requirements** — Military (MIL-STD), medical (FDA pathway), automotive, or other industry-specific requirements.

### Optional but Helpful

- **Touch requirements** — Single-touch, multi-touch, glove operation, stylus, wet environment
- **Optical requirements** — Brightness, sunlight readability, wide viewing angles, specific color accuracy needs
- **Mechanical constraints** — Maximum thickness, weight limits, mounting method, bezel requirements
- **Power budget** — If power consumption is constrained (battery-powered, thermal limitations)
- **Target timeline** — When you need samples and when production ramp begins
- **Current display** — If you're replacing an existing display, provide the current part number and any issues you're solving
- **Budget range** — If you have a target cost per unit, sharing it helps us focus on viable options

### Existing Part Numbers

If you're quoting a specific display from our catalog or a competitor's product, include the part number. For [EOL replacement projects](/support/eol-parts), include the discontinued part number and manufacturer.

## What Happens After You Submit

1. **Acknowledgment** — We confirm receipt of your request, typically within a few hours during business days.
2. **Engineering review** — Our engineering team reviews your requirements. If we need clarification, we'll reach out directly — usually by phone or email.
3. **Proposal** — We provide a detailed quote including recommended product(s), pricing by volume tier, lead times, and any NRE charges for custom work. Custom projects include a preliminary timeline with milestones.
4. **Discussion** — Most projects benefit from a technical conversation to refine requirements and explore options. We'll schedule a call with the right engineer for your application.
