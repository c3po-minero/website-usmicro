# Frequently Asked Questions

## Ordering

### What are your minimum order quantities (MOQs)?
MOQs vary by product type and customization level. Standard catalog displays may have MOQs as low as 1–100 units. Custom displays with modifications (optical bonding, custom cover glass, touch integration) typically start at 100–500 units. Fully custom designs with custom tooling may require 1,000+ units for production orders. We provide exact MOQs as part of the quotation process.

### What are typical lead times?
Standard catalog displays ship in 2–4 weeks from stock or near-stock inventory. Modified catalog displays (bonding, touch, cover glass) typically require 6–8 weeks. Fully custom display projects require 8–16 weeks for initial samples after design approval, with production orders following in 6–10 weeks. Lead times depend on technology, factory loading, and customization scope — we provide specific timelines with every quote.

### Can I get samples before committing to production quantities?
Yes. We provide engineering samples and evaluation units for most products. Sample quantities are typically 1–10 units. For custom designs, sample costs may include NRE charges that are credited toward production orders. Contact us to discuss sample availability for specific products.

### How does pricing work for custom displays?
Custom display pricing depends on panel technology, size, resolution, customization scope (optical bonding, touch, cover glass, special coatings), and order volume. We provide detailed pricing breakdowns with every quotation. Volume pricing tiers are available for production quantities. [Request a quote](/support/request-quote) with your requirements for accurate pricing.

### Do you offer blanket purchase orders or scheduled releases?
Yes. For production programs with predictable demand, we support blanket POs with scheduled releases. This approach can improve lead times and pricing by allowing us to plan production and inventory proactively.

### What payment terms do you offer?
Standard payment terms are Net 30 for qualified accounts. We also accept credit cards and wire transfers. New accounts may require prepayment for initial orders. NRE charges for custom designs are typically invoiced at project kickoff.

## Technical

### What display interfaces do you support?
We support all standard display interfaces including MIPI DSI, LVDS, eDP, RGB (parallel), SPI, I²C, MCU (8080/6800), HDMI, DisplayPort, and VGA. Interface selection depends on the display technology, resolution, and your system's processor or controller. Our engineers can recommend the optimal interface for your application and provide interface conversion boards if needed.

### What operating temperature ranges are available?
Standard commercial temperature range is 0°C to +50°C. Extended industrial ranges include -20°C to +70°C and -30°C to +80°C. Wide temperature displays for automotive and military applications operate at -40°C to +85°C or wider. Storage temperature ranges are typically broader than operating ranges. Specify your environmental requirements and we'll recommend displays validated for your conditions.

### How much customization is possible on a standard display?
Significant customization is available on most standard panels without requiring new tooling:

- **Optical bonding** — Air-gap elimination for improved readability and ruggedness
- **Cover glass** — Custom shape, thickness, printing, AR/AG/AF coatings, antimicrobial treatments
- **Touch integration** — PCAP touch panel overlay or on-cell/in-cell touch options
- **Backlight modification** — Brightness levels, color temperature, dimming interface
- **Interface adaptation** — Adapter boards for interface conversion
- **FPC/connector changes** — Modified flex cable length or connector type
- **Bezel printing** — Custom colors, logos, and markings

For modifications beyond these, we design fully custom displays with custom tooling.

### What touch panel technologies do you offer?
Our primary touch technology is projected capacitive (PCAP), which supports multi-touch, glove operation, and wet-environment use. We also offer resistive touch panels for applications requiring stylus input or operation in extreme environments. Touch panels can be integrated with TFT, OLED, and monochrome displays in sizes from 2" to 32"+. See our [touch panel page](/products/touch-panels) for details.

### Can your displays work outdoors in direct sunlight?
Yes. Sunlight-readable displays require high brightness (typically 1,000+ nits), anti-reflective or anti-glare surface treatments, and optical bonding to minimize internal reflections. We engineer outdoor-readable display solutions for applications including marine equipment, outdoor kiosks, transportation, and military systems. See our [sunlight readable displays page](/products/enhancements/sunlight-readable) for details.

### Do you support custom optical bonding?
Yes. Optical bonding eliminates the air gap between the display panel and the cover glass, which improves contrast ratio, reduces reflections, and increases mechanical strength. We offer both LOCA (liquid optically clear adhesive) and OCA (optically clear adhesive film) bonding. See our [optical bonding page](/products/enhancements/optical-bonding).

### What is the typical lifespan of your displays?
Display lifespan depends on technology and usage. TFT LCD backlights are rated at 30,000–100,000 hours to half-brightness. OLED displays have technology-dependent lifetimes that vary with brightness and duty cycle. Character and graphic LCDs have extremely long lifetimes. For applications requiring 10+ year product lifecycles, we proactively manage component availability and provide [EOL replacement support](/support/eol-parts).

## Shipping and Logistics

### Do you ship internationally?
Yes. US Micro Products ships worldwide. Our supply chain spans six locations across three continents, and we manage international logistics daily. We handle export documentation, customs classification, and compliance requirements. Standard shipping options include air freight and sea freight with various service levels.

### How are displays packaged for shipping?
Displays are packaged per industry standards for electrostatic-sensitive and fragile components. Packaging includes anti-static bags, foam cushioning, and corrugated cartons sized to the product. For large or high-value shipments, we use custom packaging designed to protect displays during transit. Packaging can be customized to your receiving requirements.

### Can you ship to our contract manufacturer directly?
Yes. We regularly ship directly to contract manufacturers, EMS providers, and production facilities worldwide. We can accommodate specific labeling, packaging, and delivery scheduling requirements to support your production line.

### Do you handle customs and export compliance?
Yes. We manage export compliance including EAR classification, HTS codes, and country-of-origin documentation. For ITAR-controlled programs, we maintain appropriate compliance procedures. Contact us if your program has specific export control requirements.

## Custom Design Projects

### What is NRE and what does it cover?
NRE (non-recurring engineering) is a one-time charge that covers the engineering design work, tooling, and validation required for a custom display project. NRE typically includes: display specification development, mechanical design, tooling charges (molds for custom bezels, cover glass, light guides), prototype fabrication, and engineering validation testing. NRE amounts vary by project scope — from a few thousand dollars for simple modifications to $20,000+ for fully custom display designs with new tooling.

### What is the typical timeline for a custom display project?
A typical custom display project follows this timeline:

1. **Requirements and specification** — 1–2 weeks
2. **Design and engineering** — 2–4 weeks
3. **Tooling fabrication** — 4–8 weeks (if custom tooling required)
4. **First article / engineering samples** — 2–4 weeks after tooling
5. **Customer validation** — Customer-dependent
6. **Production ramp** — 4–8 weeks after approval

Total timeline from kickoff to production-ready is typically 12–20 weeks, depending on complexity. We provide detailed project schedules with milestone dates as part of our proposal.

### What does the custom design process look like?
Our design process follows a structured but collaborative approach:

1. **Discovery** — We discuss your application requirements, environment, performance targets, volume expectations, and timeline
2. **Technology recommendation** — Our engineers evaluate options and recommend the optimal display technology, configuration, and factory
3. **Specification** — We develop a detailed display specification with your approval
4. **Design** — Mechanical design, optical stack design, electrical interface definition, and touch configuration
5. **Prototype** — First article samples for your evaluation and testing
6. **Iterate** — Design adjustments based on your testing feedback
7. **Production release** — Finalized design documentation and production order

Throughout this process, you have a dedicated engineering contact at US Micro Products who knows your project inside and out.

### Can you help if we don't know exactly what display we need?
Absolutely. Many of our projects start with a customer who knows their application requirements but isn't sure which display technology or configuration is the best fit. That's where our engineering expertise adds the most value. We evaluate your requirements — size, resolution, brightness, operating environment, power budget, interface, touch needs, and volume — and recommend the right approach.
