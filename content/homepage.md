## Why OEMs Choose US Micro Products

**We design your display so you don't design around it.** Unlike commodity distributors, we engineer a display that works for your system — not a system you build around a display. Our Engineering Display Solution Process (EDSP) takes your requirements and delivers a production-ready solution optimized for performance, cost, and manufacturability.

Our average customer is on their third-generation product with us. That's because we don't just deliver displays — we deliver long-term partnerships backed by lifecycle management, EOL support, and next-generation product planning.
