## A

**Active Area**
The portion of a display where pixels are located and content is visible. Measured in millimeters (width × height). The active area is always smaller than the overall module dimensions due to the bezel and driver IC area.

**Active Matrix**
A display addressing scheme where each pixel has its own dedicated switching transistor (TFT). Active matrix displays maintain pixel state between refresh cycles, enabling higher contrast, faster response, and higher resolution than [passive matrix](#passive-matrix) displays. [TFT LCD](/learn/tft-display-technology) and [AMOLED](/learn/oled-technology) are active matrix technologies.

**AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode)**
An [OLED](/learn/oled-technology) display using an active matrix TFT backplane for pixel addressing. Enables high resolution, high brightness, and large display sizes. The dominant display technology for smartphones and high-end wearables. [Browse AMOLED displays →](/products/amoled-displays)

**Anti-Glare (AG)**
A surface treatment that diffuses reflected light, reducing the impact of overhead lights and environmental reflections. Applied by etching or coating the cover glass surface. Slightly reduces image sharpness compared to a glossy surface. See also [Anti-Reflective](#anti-reflective-ar).

**Anti-Reflective (AR)**
A multi-layer dielectric coating applied to cover glass that reduces surface reflections to below 0.5%. Improves display readability in bright ambient conditions without the sharpness trade-off of anti-glare treatments. Critical for [outdoor](/applications/harsh-environments) and [marine](/applications/marine) displays.

**Aspect Ratio**
The ratio of display width to height. Common aspect ratios: 4:3 (traditional), 16:9 (widescreen), 16:10 (wide format). Expressed as width:height.

## B

**Backlight**
The light source behind an LCD panel that provides illumination. Modern displays use LED backlights exclusively, in edge-lit or direct-lit configurations. OLED displays do not require backlights — each pixel generates its own light. See our [TFT guide](/learn/tft-display-technology) for backlight details.

**Brightness (Luminance)**
The intensity of light emitted by a display, measured in nits (candelas per square meter, cd/m²). Typical ranges: 200-500 nits for indoor use, 1,000+ nits for sunlight readability. See also [Nits](#nits).

**Burn-In**
Permanent image retention caused by uneven degradation of display pixels. In OLED displays, pixels displaying static bright content degrade faster than surrounding pixels, leaving a ghost image. LCD displays can experience temporary image retention but not permanent burn-in. See our [OLED guide](/learn/oled-technology) for mitigation strategies.

## C
