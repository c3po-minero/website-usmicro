# Display Technology Learning Center

US Micro Products has spent 25+ years engineering display solutions across every major display technology. Our Learning Center distills that expertise into comprehensive guides, reference materials, and educational resources for design engineers, procurement professionals, and project managers evaluating display technologies for their products.

Whether you're specifying your first display or your hundredth, these resources provide the technical foundation for informed decisions.

## Technology Guides

### [TFT Display Technology Guide](/learn/tft-display-technology)
The most comprehensive display technology in production today. Our TFT guide covers how thin-film transistor displays work, the differences between IPS, TN, and MVA panel types, interface options (SPI, RGB, LVDS, MIPI DSI), specification interpretation, and selection criteria for your application. Essential reading for anyone specifying a color display.

### [LCD Display Technology Guide](/learn/lcd-technology)
The foundational display technology. Our LCD guide covers liquid crystal principles, passive vs. active matrix architectures, character and graphic LCD types, STN/FSTN/TN variants, backlighting options, and when to choose LCD technology. Covers the full range from simple character modules to advanced graphic displays.

### [OLED Display Technology Guide](/learn/oled-technology)
Self-emitting displays with true blacks, exceptional contrast, and ultra-thin profiles. Our OLED guide covers organic light-emitting diode principles, AMOLED vs. PMOLED architectures, manufacturing processes, benefits and limitations, and application guidance for wearables, medical, instrumentation, and consumer products.

### [Touch Screen Technology Guide](/learn/touch-screen-technology)
How touch input technologies work and how to specify them. Our touch guide covers projected capacitive (PCAP), resistive, surface acoustic wave (SAW), and infrared technologies. Includes sensor design, cover glass options, controller selection, multi-touch implementation, and environmental considerations like glove mode and wet operation.

### [Open Frame Monitor Guide](/learn/open-frame-monitors)
Pre-assembled display modules for integration into kiosks, gaming cabinets, industrial equipment, and custom enclosures. Our guide covers what open frame monitors are, how they differ from bare display panels, size and interface options, touch integration, mounting standards, and selection criteria.

## Reference

### [Display Technology Glossary](/learn/glossary)
