# Inventory Management Services

US Micro Products manages display inventory so your production line never stops waiting for components. Our inventory management programs — safety stock, end-of-life management, demand forecasting, and consignment — buffer your production from the supply disruptions, long lead times, and component discontinuations that are endemic in the display industry.

## The Display Supply Chain Problem

Display panels are not commodity components you can reorder overnight. The realities of display sourcing create specific supply chain risks:

**Long lead times.** Standard display panel lead times run 8-16 weeks. Custom displays can require 12-20 weeks. A production stoppage caused by a display shortage means 2-4 months before new stock arrives — an unacceptable gap for most manufacturers.

**Allocation and shortages.** Display panel production is concentrated among a small number of fabrication facilities. When demand spikes or production capacity is constrained, panels go on allocation. Smaller customers are typically the first to be affected.

**End-of-life (EOL) events.** Panel manufacturers discontinue display models with limited notice — sometimes as little as 6 months. If your product depends on a specific panel, an EOL notice can trigger an urgent redesign unless buffer stock exists.

**Minimum order quantities (MOQ).** Panel manufacturers enforce MOQs that may exceed your near-term demand. Without inventory management, you either over-purchase (tying up capital) or under-purchase (risking shortages).

## Our Inventory Programs

### Safety Stock

We maintain dedicated buffer inventory of your display components at our facilities. Safety stock levels are set based on your consumption rate, lead time, and risk tolerance:

- **Standard program** — 4-8 weeks of buffer stock maintained at our Austin or Shenzhen warehouse
- **Extended program** — 12-16 weeks of buffer stock for critical or single-source components
- **Custom program** — Stock levels set to your specific requirements and replenished on agreed schedules

Safety stock is allocated exclusively to your account — not shared with other customers. You draw against it as needed; we replenish from the factory on a rolling basis.

### End-of-Life (EOL) Management

Display panel EOL events are not a question of if but when. Our proactive EOL management protects your products:

- **EOL monitoring** — We track product lifecycle status for every display we supply, providing advance notice of upcoming EOL events
- **Last-time-buy coordination** — When EOL is announced, we calculate your lifetime remaining demand and coordinate last-time-buy quantities with the panel manufacturer
- **Bridge stock** — We hold last-time-buy inventory at our facilities, shipping against your orders over the remaining product lifecycle
- **Replacement qualification** — Our engineering team identifies and qualifies form-fit-function replacement panels before your existing stock is exhausted. See our [EOL parts replacement program](/support/eol-parts)

### Demand Forecasting Support

We work with your procurement team to develop accurate demand forecasts that optimize inventory levels:

- **Rolling forecasts** — Quarterly reviews of your projected demand, adjusted for seasonality, product ramps, and market conditions
- **Lead time alignment** — Forecast horizons matched to actual panel lead times to ensure orders are placed with adequate runway
- **Allocation protection** — During industry-wide shortages, documented forecasts strengthen our position with panel manufacturers for allocation priority

### Consignment Inventory

For high-volume programs, we offer consignment inventory at your facility or your contract manufacturer's location:

- Display stock physically located at your production site
- Title transfers on consumption (you pay when you use it)
- Automatic replenishment based on consumption triggers
- Eliminates shipping lead time for production line delivery

## How It Works

1. **Baseline** — We analyze your current and projected display consumption, lead times, and risk factors
2. **Program design** — We recommend safety stock levels, replenishment triggers, and EOL strategies tailored to your products
3. **Implementation** — We build initial stock and establish monitoring and replenishment processes
4. **Ongoing management** — Quarterly reviews adjust stock levels based on actual consumption and forecast changes
5. **EOL response** — When EOL events occur, we execute pre-planned response strategies without disrupting your production

## Benefits

- **Production continuity** — Buffer stock absorbs supply disruptions without affecting your production schedule
- **Reduced capital exposure** — We carry the inventory; you draw against it as needed
- **EOL protection** — Proactive management prevents the scramble and premium pricing of reactive EOL response
- **Simplified procurement** — One vendor managing stock levels, forecasts, and replenishment frees your procurement team for higher-value activities
- **Global flexibility** — Inventory held at facilities in the US and Asia, shipped to your locations worldwide via our [logistics services](/services/logistics)
