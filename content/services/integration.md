# Display Integration & Bonding Services

US Micro Products transforms standard display panels into complete, application-ready assemblies through our display integration services. Optical bonding, cover glass lamination, open frame monitor assembly, bezel and housing integration, touch panel integration, and complete module assembly — each service adds value that bridges the gap between a raw display panel and the finished component your product requires.

## Optical Bonding

Optical bonding is our most-requested integration service — and the single modification with the greatest impact on display performance in demanding environments.

### What Is Optical Bonding?

Optical bonding permanently laminates the display panel to a cover glass (or touch panel) using an optically clear adhesive (OCA) or liquid optically clear adhesive (LOCA). This eliminates the air gap present in standard display assemblies.

### Why It Matters

The air gap in a standard display creates two internal glass-to-air surfaces that reflect ambient light back toward the viewer. These reflections reduce effective contrast and wash out the display in bright environments. The air gap also traps moisture that condenses on internal surfaces, creates space for dust infiltration, and allows the panel and cover glass to vibrate independently.

Optical bonding eliminates all of these problems:

- **Contrast improvement** — Up to 400% improvement in effective contrast ratio by eliminating internal reflections
- **Sunlight readability** — Dramatically improved outdoor readability at any backlight brightness level
- **Condensation prevention** — No air gap means no internal surfaces for moisture to condense on
- **Mechanical strength** — Bonded assembly acts as a single rigid element, improving shock and vibration resistance
- **Reduced parallax** — Eliminates the visual offset between touch surface and displayed content

### Bonding Methods

**OCA (Optically Clear Adhesive) film.** Pre-formed adhesive film applied between surfaces. Excellent optical clarity, consistent bond thickness, and good rework capability. Preferred for flat panels up to approximately 15".

**LOCA (Liquid Optically Clear Adhesive).** Liquid adhesive dispensed and UV-cured between surfaces. Accommodates slight surface irregularities, fills gaps uniformly, and scales to large panel sizes. Preferred for panels above 15" and for bonding to curved or irregular surfaces.

We select the bonding method based on your display size, surface characteristics, environmental requirements, and production volume.

## Cover Glass Integration

Custom cover glass transforms a bare display panel into a branded, protected, application-specific component.

### Cover Glass Options

- **Chemically strengthened glass** — Corning Gorilla Glass, AGC Dragontrail, Schott Xensation. 4-8x impact resistance versus standard soda-lime glass
- **Standard soda-lime glass** — Cost-effective option for non-impact applications
- **Anti-reflective (AR) coatings** — Reduce surface reflections below 0.5% for outdoor and high-ambient readability
- **Anti-glare (AG) treatments** — Diffuse reflected light for environments with multiple light sources
- **Anti-fingerprint (AF) / oleophobic coatings** — Reduce smudge adhesion on touch displays
- **Antimicrobial coatings** — Silver ion or copper-based treatments for [medical](/applications/medical) and public-facing applications
- **Custom printing** — Silk-screened bezels, logos, icons, and branding on the cover glass perimeter
- **Custom shapes** — CNC-cut to your specifications including rounded corners, notches, and mounting features

## Touch Panel Integration

We integrate [capacitive touch panels](/products/touch-panels) with display panels as bonded assemblies:

- Touch-to-display optical bonding for reduced parallax and improved optical performance
- Cover glass-to-touch bonding for complete front-surface assemblies
- Touch controller integration and calibration
- Glove mode, wet-touch rejection, and sensitivity tuning for your application requirements

## Open Frame Monitor Assembly

Our [open frame monitors](/products/open-frame-monitors) are assembled in-house from display panels, driver boards, power supplies, and optional touch panels. Integration services for OFM products include:

- Display panel to driver board integration and testing
- Touch panel integration and calibration
- Housing and bezel assembly with VESA mount provisions
- Cable assembly and connector integration
- Functional and safety testing

## Housing and Bezel Integration

For applications requiring more than a bare display module, we integrate displays into custom housings and bezels:

- Aluminum, stainless steel, or plastic bezels — machined or injection molded
- Gasket sealing for IP-rated assemblies
- EMI shielding for sensitive applications
- Thermal interface materials for heat dissipation
- Mounting provisions (VESA, threaded inserts, brackets)
- Cable routing and strain relief

## Quality and Process Control

All integration processes are performed under our ISO 9001 quality management system:

- **Clean room environment** — Optical bonding and cover glass integration performed in controlled environments to prevent particulate contamination
- **Incoming inspection** — All components inspected before integration
- **In-process inspection** — Bonding quality, alignment, and optical performance verified at each stage
- **Final inspection** — Complete cosmetic and functional inspection of finished assemblies
- **Lot traceability** — Every assembly traceable to component lots and process records
