# EMS / PCB Assembly Services

US Micro Products provides electronic manufacturing services (EMS) purpose-built for display assemblies and display-related electronics. Our SMT lines, chip-on-board capabilities, sub-assembly processes, and box build operations are optimized for the specific requirements of display driver boards, backlight controllers, touch controller circuits, interface conversion boards, and complete display system assemblies.

## Why Display-Focused EMS

Generic EMS providers build whatever you send them. They don't understand display electronics — the timing requirements of LVDS and MIPI interfaces, the noise sensitivity of touch controllers, the thermal characteristics of LED backlight drivers, or the EMC implications of display cable routing.

Our EMS team works with display electronics daily. They understand the relationship between the PCB assembly and the display it drives. This domain expertise translates to fewer manufacturing issues, faster debug when problems arise, and better first-pass yield on display assemblies.

## Capabilities

### Surface Mount Technology (SMT)

High-speed automated SMT placement for display driver boards and controller circuits. Our SMT lines handle component packages from 0201 passives through fine-pitch QFP and BGA devices common in display interface ICs, touch controllers, and embedded processors.

- **Pick-and-place accuracy:** ±0.025 mm at 3σ
- **Component range:** 0201 through 45 mm BGA
- **Solder paste:** Lead-free (SAC305) and leaded options
- **Inspection:** Automated optical inspection (AOI) on 100% of assemblies; X-ray inspection available for BGA and hidden-joint verification
- **Reflow:** Convection reflow with programmable thermal profiles optimized for display electronics thermal budgets

### Chip-on-Board (COB)

Wire bonding and glob-top encapsulation for COB display driver ICs. COB construction reduces assembly thickness and cost for character LCD, graphic LCD, and small TFT display driver boards.

### Sub-Assembly and Box Build

Complete display system assembly including:
- PCB-to-display integration (FPC bonding, connector mating, cable routing)
- Backlight assembly and testing
- Touch sensor integration and calibration
- Housing and bezel assembly
- Thermal interface material application
- Conformal coating application
- Final functional testing

### Testing and Quality

Every assembly is tested before shipment:
- **In-circuit test (ICT)** — Verifies component placement, solder quality, and electrical connectivity
- **Functional test** — Powers the assembly and verifies display output, touch response, communication, and backlight operation
- **Visual inspection** — Trained inspectors verify cosmetic quality, connector seating, and assembly conformance
- **Burn-in** — Extended powered operation available for high-reliability applications

## Quality System

Our EMS operations are covered by our ISO 9001 quality management system:
- IPC-A-610 Class 2 (standard) and Class 3 (high reliability) workmanship standards
- Full lot traceability — every assembly traceable to component lots, operators, and process parameters
- Statistical process control (SPC) on critical parameters
- Documented procedures for every process step
- Corrective and preventive action (CAPA) system

## Integration with Display Manufacturing

The real advantage of our EMS services is vertical integration with our display manufacturing. When we build both the display and the electronics that drive it, we control the entire system:

- **Matched testing** — The display panel and driver board are tested together as a system, not as separate components
- **Design feedback** — Our EMS engineers collaborate with our display engineers to optimize the electrical interface between board and panel
- **Single accountability** — If the display doesn't work correctly, there's no finger-pointing between a display vendor and a separate PCB assembler. We own the complete solution.
- **Simplified logistics** — One shipment of complete, tested assemblies rather than separate component shipments that you must receive, inventory, and assemble

## Typical Applications

- Display driver boards for [custom TFT](/products/custom-displays/tft) and [custom AMOLED](/products/custom-displays/amoled) projects
- Touch controller circuits for [custom touch panels](/products/touch-panels)
- Interface conversion boards (HDMI-to-LVDS, USB-to-MIPI, etc.)
- Backlight driver circuits with dimming control
- [Open frame monitor](/products/open-frame-monitors) controller boards
- Complete [smart display](/products/smart-displays) system assemblies
- [Industrial tablet](/products/tablets) main boards and sub-assemblies
