# Display Manufacturing Services

US Micro Products is more than a display supplier — we're a full-service manufacturing partner. Our vertically integrated service capabilities transform raw display panels into complete, tested, production-ready assemblies and manage the supply chain from factory to your production line.

Most display suppliers ship panels in brown boxes. We engineer complete solutions — bonded, integrated, tested, inventoried, and delivered when and where your production requires them. This integrated approach reduces your vendor count, simplifies your supply chain, and gives you a single accountable partner from design through delivery.

## Our Services

### [EMS / PCB Assembly](/services/ems)

Electronic manufacturing services for display-related assemblies. Surface mount technology (SMT), chip-on-board (COB), sub-assembly, and box build — all performed in-house with full traceability and ISO 9001 quality controls.

Our EMS capabilities are purpose-built for display electronics: driver boards, controller circuits, backlight drivers, touch controllers, and interface conversion boards. By integrating PCB assembly with display manufacturing, we deliver tested, complete assemblies rather than separate components that you must integrate on your production floor.

### [Display Integration & Bonding](/services/integration)

Optical bonding, cover glass lamination, open frame monitor assembly, housing integration, and complete display module assembly. These value-added services transform standard display panels into application-specific solutions.

Optical bonding alone — our most-requested integration service — improves sunlight readability by up to 400%, eliminates internal condensation, and increases mechanical shock resistance. Combined with custom cover glass, bezel printing, and housing integration, our display integration services deliver drop-in-ready assemblies.

### [Inventory Management](/services/inventory-management)

Safety stock programs, end-of-life (EOL) management, demand forecasting support, and consignment inventory. We protect your production schedule from the supply disruptions, allocation shortages, and component discontinuations that plague the display industry.

Display panels have long lead times (often 8-16 weeks) and are subject to allocation during demand spikes. Our inventory management programs maintain buffer stock at our facilities, ensuring your production line never stops waiting for displays.

### [Logistics & Kitting](/services/logistics)

Global warehousing, kitting, custom packaging, and direct-to-line delivery from our facilities in Austin, Los Angeles, New York, Shenzhen, and Taichung. We manage the physical movement of displays from factory to your door — or directly to your contract manufacturer's production line anywhere in the world.

## Why Integrated Services Matter

### Reduced Complexity
One purchase order, one supplier qualification, one quality system to audit. Instead of managing separate vendors for panels, bonding, PCB assembly, inventory, and logistics, you manage one relationship with US Micro Products.

### Faster Time to Market
Our engineering team handles display selection, customization, integration, and manufacturing setup in parallel. Your design engineers focus on system-level development while we handle everything display-related.

### Quality Control
Every service — from PCB assembly through optical bonding to final packaging — is performed under our ISO 9001 quality management system with full lot traceability. A single quality system across all services eliminates the inter-vendor quality gaps that create field failures.

### Supply Chain Resilience
Our global presence and inventory programs buffer your production from supply disruptions. When panel manufacturers face allocation, lead time extensions, or EOL events, our supply chain team has already prepared alternatives.

## How Our Services Work Together

A typical engagement combines multiple services into a seamless manufacturing solution:

1. **Engineering** — We work with your design team to select and customize the right display ([custom display solutions](/products/custom-displays))
2. **Integration** — We bond, laminate, and assemble the display into a complete module ([integration services](/services/integration))
3. **EMS** — We build the driver electronics and integrate them with the display ([EMS services](/services/ems))
4. **Inventory** — We maintain safety stock and manage component lifecycles ([inventory management](/services/inventory-management))
5. **Logistics** — We ship finished assemblies to your production line on your schedule ([logistics & kitting](/services/logistics))

The result: you receive a tested, complete display assembly — not a box of components to figure out.
