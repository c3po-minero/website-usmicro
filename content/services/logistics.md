# Logistics & Kitting Services

US Micro Products manages the physical movement and preparation of display components from our global facilities to your production line. Kitting, custom packaging, warehousing, and direct-to-line delivery — we handle the logistics so your team can focus on building products.

## Global Warehouse Network

We operate from facilities strategically positioned for efficient delivery to manufacturing locations worldwide:

- **Austin, Texas** — US headquarters, primary North American distribution
- **Los Angeles, California** — West Coast distribution and Pacific Rim gateway
- **New York** — East Coast distribution and European shipping
- **Shenzhen, China** — Asia manufacturing hub, direct access to major panel manufacturers
- **Taichung, Taiwan** — Display industry hub, secondary Asia distribution

This network enables us to ship from the facility closest to your production site, minimizing transit time and shipping cost. For customers with multiple manufacturing locations, we can split shipments from different facilities to serve each plant optimally.

## Kitting Services

Kitting consolidates multiple display components into single, production-ready packages. Instead of receiving separate shipments of panels, touch sensors, driver boards, cables, and cover glass that your receiving department must match, count, and route to the production line — you receive complete kits ready for assembly.

### What We Kit

- Display panels with matched touch panels
- Display assemblies with driver boards and cables
- Complete bill-of-materials for display sub-assemblies
- Multi-component display kits (panel + cover glass + FPC + connector)
- Mixed kits across product variants for flexible production scheduling

### Kitting Benefits

- **Reduced line-side inventory** — One kit per unit instead of multiple component bins
- **Fewer receiving transactions** — One kit receipt versus multiple component receipts
- **Reduced assembly errors** — Pre-matched components eliminate mismatched part selection
- **Simplified material planning** — Kit quantity equals unit quantity, simplifying MRP

## Custom Packaging

Display components are fragile and specification-critical — a scratched cover glass or cracked FPC connection is a rejected unit. Our packaging is engineered for display protection:

- **ESD-safe packaging** — All display components shipped in anti-static packaging to prevent electrostatic damage
- **Custom foam inserts** — CNC-cut foam inserts matched to your display assembly dimensions for secure transit protection
- **Tray packaging** — Stackable trays for production-line-friendly handling of high-volume display components
- **Moisture barrier bags** — Sealed bags with desiccant for moisture-sensitive components during transit and storage
- **Customer-specified packaging** — We package to your receiving specifications, labeling standards, and barcode requirements

## Shipping and Customs

### Shipping Options

- **Air freight** — For urgent and time-sensitive shipments from any facility
- **Ocean freight** — Cost-optimized for high-volume, schedule-flexible shipments from Asia facilities
- **Ground/truck** — Domestic US delivery from Austin, LA, and NY facilities
- **Expedited/same-day** — Available from stocked inventory for production emergencies

### Import and Customs

Our logistics team manages customs documentation, harmonized tariff classification, and import compliance for international shipments:

- Commercial invoices and packing lists prepared to your import requirements
- Country of origin documentation and certificates as required
- Harmonized tariff code classification for display products
- Coordination with your customs broker or use of our established brokerage relationships

## Direct-to-Line Delivery

For customers using contract manufacturers (CMs), we ship directly to your CM's production facility — eliminating the intermediate step of receiving at your location and reshipping to the CM:

- Ship-to addresses configured for each of your manufacturing partners
- Delivery scheduling aligned with your CM's production calendar
- Packaging and labeling matched to your CM's receiving requirements
- Split shipments across multiple CM locations from a single order

## Integration with Inventory Management

Our logistics services work hand-in-hand with our [inventory management programs](/services/inventory-management):

- Automatic shipment triggers when your safety stock draw-down hits replenishment thresholds
- Scheduled deliveries from consignment stock at our facilities
- Priority shipping for EOL bridge stock to maintain production continuity
- Consolidated shipments that combine multiple SKUs into efficient deliveries
