# Quality & Certifications

Quality at US Micro Products is not a department — it's embedded in every stage of our process from design through delivery. When your display goes into a surgical instrument, a cockpit panel, or an industrial controller, the quality of that display directly affects the safety and performance of the end product. We engineer and inspect accordingly.

## ISO 9001 Certification

US Micro Products maintains ISO 9001 certification for our quality management system. This certification covers our complete operation: design, sourcing, manufacturing oversight, inspection, testing, and delivery of custom display solutions.

Our QMS provides:

- **Document control** — All specifications, drawings, procedures, and work instructions are revision-controlled and accessible
- **Change management** — Engineering changes follow a formal ECN process with impact assessment, customer notification, and validation
- **Corrective and preventive action (CAPA)** — Systematic root cause analysis and corrective action for any quality escape or process deviation
- **Management review** — Regular review of quality metrics, customer feedback, and continuous improvement initiatives
- **Internal audits** — Scheduled audits verify compliance and identify improvement opportunities

## Incoming Inspection and Testing

Every display shipment undergoes incoming inspection before it ships to our customers:

- **Visual inspection** — Cosmetic quality, pixel defects, polarizer condition, connector integrity, and labeling verification
- **Dimensional verification** — Critical mechanical dimensions checked against drawing specifications
- **Electrical testing** — Power consumption, interface signal integrity, backlight performance, and touch sensor functionality
- **Optical measurement** — Brightness, contrast ratio, color coordinates, and viewing angle verification on sampling plans appropriate to order volume and application criticality
- **Environmental screening** — For high-reliability applications, displays undergo thermal cycling, humidity exposure, or vibration screening per customer specifications

## Industry-Specific Quality Standards

### Military and Defense (MIL-STD)

Defense display applications demand the highest reliability and environmental performance. Our quality processes support:

- **MIL-STD-810** — Environmental testing methods for temperature, humidity, altitude, vibration, and shock
- **MIL-STD-461** — EMI/EMC testing requirements for military electronic equipment
- **MIL-STD-883** — Test methods for microelectronics applicable to COB and wire-bonded display assemblies
- **ITAR compliance** — We understand the export control requirements for defense display programs and manage our supply chain accordingly

We work with defense OEMs including Lockheed Martin and Honeywell to ensure that display components meet the specific qualification requirements of their programs.

### Medical Devices (FDA Considerations)

US Micro Products is a display component supplier, not a medical device manufacturer. However, we design our quality processes to support our medical device OEM customers' regulatory requirements:

- **Design documentation** — Complete material specifications, test reports, and traceability records compatible with FDA Design Controls (21 CFR 820)
- **Supplier qualification** — Our ISO 9001 QMS and documentation practices support medical device companies' supplier qualification requirements
- **Component traceability** — Full lot traceability from raw materials through finished display assembly
- **Change notification** — Formal notification process for any material, process, or supplier change that could affect form, fit, or function
- **Long lifecycle support** — Medical device lifecycles of 7–15+ years require proactive obsolescence management. See our [EOL parts program](/support/eol-parts).

### Automotive Quality

Automotive display applications require reliability under extreme thermal, vibration, and lifecycle conditions. Our quality processes address:

- **AEC-Q qualification** — Support for component-level qualification testing per Automotive Electronics Council standards
- **PPAP** — Production Part Approval Process documentation for automotive OEM supplier qualification
- **FMEA** — Failure Mode and Effects Analysis as part of our design process for automotive display projects
- **Extended temperature validation** — Testing across -40°C to +85°C (or wider) operating temperature ranges per automotive specifications

## Traceability

Every display assembly we ship is traceable. Our traceability system links each unit to:

- Display panel manufacturer and lot number
- Component lot numbers (backlight LEDs, touch sensors, cover glass, FPCs)
- Inspection records and test data
- Production date and operator records
- Shipping and delivery records

This traceability supports warranty resolution, field failure analysis, and regulatory compliance for industries that require it.

## Continuous Improvement

We track quality metrics including:

- First-pass yield rates
- Customer return rates and RMA analysis
- On-time delivery performance
- Supplier quality scorecards
- Corrective action effectiveness

These metrics drive our continuous improvement program and are reviewed regularly by management. When we identify a trend or a process gap, we address it systematically — not reactively.
