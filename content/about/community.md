# Community Involvement

US Micro Products has been part of the Austin, Texas community since 1996. The technology ecosystem that makes Austin a hub for engineering talent, innovative companies, and global business also depends on investment in education, workforce development, and community infrastructure. We believe in contributing to the community that has supported our growth for nearly three decades.

## STEM Education

The display industry — and the broader electronics industry — depends on a pipeline of engineers, technicians, and scientists. US Micro Products supports STEM education initiatives that help develop the next generation of technical talent:

- **Local school partnerships** — We work with Austin-area schools to provide real-world context for STEM curricula. Display technology touches physics (optics, materials science), electrical engineering, computer science, and manufacturing — making it an excellent vehicle for applied learning.
- **University engagement** — Connections with engineering programs at Texas universities support internship opportunities and expose students to careers in display technology and electronics manufacturing.
- **Industry mentorship** — Our engineers participate in mentorship programs that connect students and early-career professionals with experienced practitioners in the display and electronics industry.

## Austin Community

Austin has been our home since day one. We support the local community through:

- **Local hiring and development** — We prioritize hiring locally and developing talent within the Austin technology community
- **Community organizations** — Participation in and support for Austin-area nonprofit organizations and industry groups
- **Industry leadership** — Active participation in regional technology and manufacturing organizations that strengthen Austin's position as a center for electronics innovation

## Our Commitment

Community involvement at US Micro Products isn't a checkbox exercise. It reflects the same values that drive our business: do the right thing, invest in people, and build relationships that last. The Austin community has been good to us, and we're committed to giving back in meaningful ways.
