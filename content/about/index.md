# About US Micro Products

US Micro Products was founded in 1996 in Austin, Texas with a straightforward premise: OEMs deserve a display partner that cares as much about their product as they do. Nearly three decades later, that premise drives every engineering decision, every supply chain relationship, and every conversation with our customers.

## The Fabless Model

We design and deliver custom display solutions. We don't own factories — we operate a fabless manufacturing model that gives us access to the best display technology from the best manufacturers worldwide, without locking our customers into a single production line or a single technology.

Our supply chain spans six locations across three continents. Manufacturing partners in China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea give us access to the full spectrum of display technologies — TFT LCD, AMOLED, PMOLED, character LCD, graphic LCD, e-paper, and more. We select the optimal technology and factory for each project based on the application requirements, not based on which factory we happen to own.

This model means our engineering recommendations are technology-agnostic. When we tell you that a particular TFT panel from a particular manufacturer is the right choice for your application, it's because the engineering supports that conclusion — not because we need to fill capacity on a production line.

## Small Team, Global Reach

US Micro Products is approximately 30 people. We are not a faceless corporation with a call center. When you work with us, you work with the same engineers and project managers from first conversation through production ramp and beyond. Our customers know their USMP contacts by name, and our contacts know their customers' products intimately.

But don't let the headcount fool you. Our global supply chain, manufacturing partnerships, and logistics infrastructure give us capabilities that rival companies many times our size. We've earned a place on the Inc. 5000 list of America's fastest-growing private companies — a recognition that reflects both the quality of our work and the trust our customers place in us.

## Who We Work With

Our customer base spans more than 20 industries and includes some of the world's most demanding OEMs:

- **Aerospace and defense** — Lockheed Martin, Honeywell
- **Medical devices** — Abbott, Philips, GE Healthcare, Siemens
- **Industrial and instrumentation** — Companies building equipment that operates in harsh environments, extreme temperatures, and safety-critical applications

We also work with startups building their first product and mid-size companies on their third generation design with us. The common thread is that these are companies who need more than a commodity display — they need an engineered solution and a partner who understands their application.

## The Human Touch

"We add the human touch to technology" isn't a marketing line. It describes how we operate.

Display technology is complex. The number of panel options, interface standards, optical specifications, touch technologies, and environmental ratings creates a matrix of decisions that most product teams don't navigate regularly. Our engineers navigate it daily — roughly 200 custom designs per year across every major display technology and application environment.

We act as an extension of your engineering team. We bring display-specific expertise that most companies don't have in-house, and we apply it with the same commitment to your product's success that your own team brings. Our average customer is on their third generation product with us. That kind of repeat engagement doesn't happen unless the partnership delivers real value.

## What We Believe

**Do the right thing.** Long-term relationships with customers and suppliers are built on trust. We recommend the right solution for your application, even when a more expensive option would be more profitable for us.

**Take action.** Display projects have timelines. We respond quickly, solve problems proactively, and maintain the urgency that your development schedule demands.

**Have fun.** We're engineers who love display technology. That enthusiasm translates to creative solutions and a team that genuinely enjoys solving hard problems.
