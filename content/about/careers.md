# Careers at US Micro Products

US Micro Products is a custom display manufacturer headquartered in Austin, Texas. We're approximately 30 people who design, source, and deliver display solutions for OEMs across more than 20 industries — from medical devices and aerospace to industrial equipment and consumer electronics.

We're growing, and we're looking for people who want to do meaningful technical work in a company small enough that your contributions are visible and valued.

## Why Work Here

### Real Engineering Impact

At US Micro Products, you're not a cog in a machine. Our team completes roughly 200 custom display designs per year across every major display technology. Engineers here work directly with customers, make design decisions that matter, and see their work ship in products from companies like GE Healthcare, Lockheed Martin, and Abbott.

### Small Team, Big Problems

We have the customer base and technical scope of a much larger company, but the team size of a startup. That means you'll work across technologies, industries, and disciplines. If you want to specialize narrowly and work on one thing, this probably isn't the right fit. If you want breadth, variety, and the ability to grow your expertise across display technologies, optics, touch systems, embedded electronics, and global supply chains — this is the place.

### Austin, Texas

Our headquarters is located at Research Blvd in northwest Austin — close to the tech corridor, with easy access to major highways and all the advantages of one of the country's best cities for technology professionals. Austin offers a strong engineering talent pool, no state income tax, and a quality of life that keeps people here.

### Culture

Our motto is "Do the Right Thing, Take Action, and Have Fun." That's not aspirational — it's operational. We value reliability, hard work, and genuine care for our customers and each other. We build long-term relationships internally just as we do with our customers.

## What We Look For

US Micro Products hires people who are:

- **Technically curious** — Display technology spans optics, electronics, materials science, and mechanical engineering. The best people here are the ones who want to understand all of it.
- **Customer-oriented** — Our engineers talk to customers. If you prefer to work in isolation, this isn't the right environment. If you enjoy solving real problems for real people, you'll thrive.
- **Self-directed** — In a team of 30, there's no room for people who wait to be told what to do. We hire people who see what needs to happen and make it happen.
- **Collaborative** — Small teams only work when people communicate well and help each other.
