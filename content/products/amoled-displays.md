# AMOLED Displays

US Micro Products stocks over 77 AMOLED display modules from 0.95" to 6.67", available in round, rectangular, and flexible form factors. As the #1 provider of displays for the wearable market, we bring unmatched expertise in specifying and customizing AMOLED panels for applications demanding true blacks, ultra-thin profiles, and exceptional contrast ratios.

## Why AMOLED Technology

Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode (AMOLED) displays are fundamentally different from LCDs. Each pixel emits its own light — no backlight is required. This architecture delivers several critical advantages for OEM product designers:

**True black and infinite contrast.** When a pixel is off, it produces zero light. This creates contrast ratios that are theoretically infinite and practically unmatchable by any LCD technology. Text, graphics, and UI elements appear to float on the display surface.

**Ultra-thin and lightweight.** Eliminating the backlight assembly, diffuser films, and light guide plates reduces the total display stack by 30-50% compared to equivalent TFT LCDs. For wearables, portable medical devices, and space-constrained designs, this is a critical advantage.

**Wide viewing angles.** AMOLED panels maintain consistent color and brightness at extreme viewing angles — typically exceeding 170° in all directions without the color shift common in TN and VA LCD technologies.

**Power efficiency on dark content.** Because power consumption is proportional to the lit pixels, applications with dark themes, sparse UI elements, or partial-screen updates consume significantly less power than a backlit LCD of equivalent size.

**Fast response times.** AMOLED pixel switching occurs in microseconds — orders of magnitude faster than LCD. Motion blur is essentially eliminated, making AMOLED suitable for animations, video content, and dynamic data visualization.

## Form Factors

### Round AMOLED Displays
Circular displays from 1.19" to 1.6" diameter. Purpose-built for smartwatches, fitness trackers, and circular instrument panels. Available with full-circle and flat-tire (truncated bottom) configurations.

### Rectangular AMOLED Displays
Standard aspect ratios from 0.95" to 6.67". Suited for smartphones, portable medical devices, handheld instruments, and consumer electronics where conventional rectangular form factors are required.

### Flexible AMOLED Displays
Panels built on flexible plastic substrates that can conform to curved surfaces. Enables wraparound displays, curved wearable bands, and non-planar industrial designs that rigid displays cannot address.

## Interface Options

- **MIPI DSI** — High-bandwidth serial interface standard for most AMOLED panels 1.5" and above. 1-lane, 2-lane, and 4-lane configurations available depending on resolution and frame rate requirements.
- **SPI** — Simple serial interface for small, low-resolution AMOLED modules. Minimal pin count for microcontroller-driven wearable and IoT applications.
- **Parallel RGB** — Available on select modules for legacy system compatibility.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does AMOLED compare to TFT LCD for battery-powered devices?
AMOLED consumes less power than LCD when displaying predominantly dark content because unlit pixels draw zero power. For applications with bright, full-screen white content, an LCD may be more power-efficient. Most wearable and IoT UI designs use dark themes, making AMOLED the preferred choice for battery life optimization.

### Are round AMOLED displays truly circular?
Yes. Our round AMOLED panels have circular active areas with no inactive corners. Some models include a small flat segment at the bottom ("flat tire") to accommodate the display driver IC, while others are full circle with the driver IC relocated to the FPC.

### What is the lifespan of an AMOLED display?
Modern AMOLED panels are rated for 30,000–50,000 hours at typical brightness levels. Lifespan varies with brightness setting and content — static high-brightness content degrades faster than dynamic content at moderate brightness. Our engineers can recommend mitigation strategies for long-life applications.

### Can AMOLED displays operate in sunlight?
AMOLED displays with peak brightness of 600+ nits and optical bonding are readable in bright outdoor conditions. For direct sunlight applications, we can combine high-brightness AMOLED panels with anti-reflective cover glass. However, for extreme outdoor readability, [high-brightness TFT LCDs](/products/tft-displays) may be more suitable.
