# Custom Display Solutions

US Micro Products engineers custom display solutions for OEMs who need more than standard catalog products. With over 200 custom display designs completed annually and 25+ years of experience across TFT, AMOLED, PMOLED, and LCD technologies, we transform your requirements into a production-ready display optimized for performance, cost, and manufacturability.

**We design a display that works for your system — so you don't design a system around a display.**

## The Engineering Display Solution Process (EDSP)

Our proven EDSP methodology takes your project from concept through mass production:

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis
Your engineering team shares application requirements — optical, mechanical, electrical, and environmental. We evaluate your specifications against available technologies and identify the optimal approach.

### Step 2: Technology Selection
Based on your requirements, we recommend the display technology (TFT, AMOLED, PMOLED, or LCD), panel type, interface, and customization features that best meet your performance and cost targets.

### Step 3: Design & Engineering
Our display engineers design the complete display solution — panel selection or custom panel specification, cover glass design, touch integration, optical bonding, interface circuitry, FPC routing, connector selection, and mechanical integration planning.

### Step 4: Prototype & Evaluation
We deliver working prototypes for your team to evaluate in your application. This phase includes optical testing, environmental validation, and interface verification.

### Step 5: Design Validation
Final design is validated against all specifications — optical performance, mechanical fit, environmental limits, reliability testing, and compliance requirements.

### Step 6: Production & Lifecycle Management
Volume manufacturing begins with full supply chain management. We handle ongoing production, quality control, inventory management, EOL planning, and next-generation product development.

### [Custom LCD Displays](/products/custom-displays/lcd)
Custom character and graphic LCD solutions with modified dimensions, backlights, temperature ranges, and connector configurations.

## Custom Without the NRE

Many display modifications don't require tooling charges or NRE fees. Cover glass changes, optical bonding, brightness modifications, FPC changes, and interface board modifications are engineering work — not manufacturing tooling. This means you get a customized display solution without the upfront costs that typically gate custom component decisions.

Modifications that may require tooling include fully custom panel sizes, custom LCD glass, and custom cover glass molds. Our team will clearly identify any tooling costs during the design phase.

## Minimum Order Quantities

Custom display MOQs vary by modification type:

- **Catalog modifications** (bonding, cover glass, FPC, brightness): Typically 100–500 units
- **Semi-custom panels** (modified standard panels): 500–1,000 units
- **Fully custom designs** (new panel specification): 1,000–5,000 units depending on technology

We work with companies of all sizes — from startups with initial prototype quantities to global OEMs requiring millions of units annually.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does custom display development take?
Typical timeline is 8–16 weeks from requirements lock to prototype delivery. Catalog modifications (bonding, cover glass, FPC) can be as fast as 4–6 weeks. Fully custom panel designs may require 16–24 weeks. Production ramp follows prototype approval.

### Do I need to commit to volume before starting a custom design?
No. We begin the design process based on your requirements and expected volumes. There's no commitment until you approve the prototype and issue a production order. We understand that engineering schedules and market timing are uncertain.

### What information do I need to provide to start a custom display project?
At minimum: display size range, resolution requirements, interface preference, brightness needs, environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, outdoor/indoor), touch requirements, mechanical constraints (thickness, weight, mounting), and expected annual volume. The more detail you provide, the faster we can reach an optimal design.

### Can you help if I don't know what display technology to use?
Absolutely. Many customers come to us with application requirements, not display specifications. Our engineers evaluate your application and recommend the optimal technology, panel type, and configuration. That's the value of working with a company that spans TFT, AMOLED, PMOLED, and LCD — we're technology-agnostic and recommend what's best for your product.

### How do you handle EOL (End of Life) for custom displays?
We proactively monitor our supply chain for EOL notices. When a panel or component reaches EOL, we identify replacement options, validate compatibility, and manage the transition — often before you're aware of the change. We also offer last-time-buy inventory programs to buffer transitions.
