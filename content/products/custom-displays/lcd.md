# Custom LCD Displays

US Micro Products engineers custom character and graphic LCD solutions for applications where standard catalog modules don't quite fit. Whether you need a modified outline dimension, custom backlight color, extended temperature range, or a pin-compatible replacement for a discontinued module, our LCD engineering team delivers production-ready solutions built on proven passive-matrix LCD technology.

## Character LCD Customization

Starting from our [character LCD catalog](/products/character-lcd) of 45+ modules:

- **Custom character configurations** — Non-standard row/column counts, custom character cell sizes
- **Custom character ROM** — Application-specific symbol sets, multi-language characters beyond standard ASCII
- **CGRAM programming** — Pre-programmed custom characters for common application symbols
- **Custom backlight** — Modified LED color (white, green, yellow, blue, red, amber), brightness levels, or no-backlight transflective operation
- **Modified outline** — Custom PCB dimensions, mounting hole positions, and connector placement for drop-in replacement of legacy modules
- **Extended temperature** — Validation to -40°C to 85°C with wide-temperature LC fluid and LED backlight
- **Custom connector** — Modified pin header, FPC, or custom cable assembly

## Graphic LCD Customization

Starting from our [graphic LCD catalog](/products/graphic-lcd) of 20+ modules:

- **Custom resolution** — Non-standard pixel counts for application-specific layouts
- **Panel type selection** — STN, FSTN, or TN with specific contrast, viewing angle, and color characteristics
- **COG, COB, or TAB packaging** — Package type matched to your mechanical and thickness requirements
- **Custom cover glass** — Protective lens with printing, AR coating, or EMI shielding
- **Optical bonding** — Full lamination for contrast improvement and environmental resilience
- **Custom controller/driver** — Interface and register compatibility matched to your firmware
- **Backlight modifications** — Custom brightness, color, uniformity, and dimming capability

## Common Custom LCD Projects

**Legacy module replacement.** A customer's 20×4 character LCD was discontinued by the original manufacturer. We designed a pin-compatible, outline-compatible replacement with identical electrical characteristics — zero firmware changes, zero mechanical changes. Production transition completed in 8 weeks.

**Wide-temperature instrument display.** 128×64 graphic LCD (FSTN) modified for -40°C to 85°C operation with heated backlight startup circuit and wide-temperature LC formulation. Deployed in outdoor industrial instrumentation.

**Custom medical readout.** 16×2 character LCD with custom backlight color (specific medical blue), antimicrobial cover lens, and custom connector matched to existing PCB footprint.

## Advantages of Custom LCD

**Lowest display cost.** Passive-matrix LCD remains the most cost-effective display technology for monochrome content. Custom modifications don't significantly increase unit cost.

**Supply chain stability.** LCD technology has the most mature and diversified supply chain of any display technology. Multiple qualified sources for any standard configuration.

**Drop-in replacement capability.** Our engineering team specializes in designing exact replacements for discontinued LCD modules — same outline, same connector, same electrical interface.
