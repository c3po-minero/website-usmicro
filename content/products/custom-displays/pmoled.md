# Custom PMOLED Displays

US Micro Products engineers custom PMOLED solutions for compact, battery-powered applications where power consumption, thin profiles, and high contrast are critical design parameters. Starting from our [standard PMOLED portfolio](/products/pmoled-displays) of 36+ modules, we modify cover optics, FPC configurations, display colors, and environmental ratings to match your exact requirements.

## Customization Options

### Display Configuration
- **Color selection** — Monochrome white, yellow, blue, green, or dual-color zones
- **Custom resolution** — Modified pixel count for application-specific layouts
- **Custom active area** — Adjusted visible display dimensions
- **Viewing direction** — Top, bottom, or custom viewing angle optimization

### Mechanical
- **Custom FPC** — Length, routing, connector type, and pin assignment matched to your PCB layout
- **Custom outline dimensions** — Modified module footprint for drop-in replacement of legacy displays
- **Cover lens** — Protective glass or plastic with custom shape, tint, printing, or coating
- **Thin profile optimization** — Stack-height reduction through panel selection and assembly techniques

### Optical
- **Brightness tuning** — Adjusted drive current for optimal brightness vs. lifespan balance
- **Cover lens coatings** — Anti-reflective, anti-glare, and anti-fingerprint treatments
- **Optical bonding** — Full lamination to cover glass for contrast enhancement and shock resistance
- **NVIS compatibility** — Night vision compatible configurations for military applications

### Environmental
- **Extended temperature range** — Validation to -40°C to 80°C for automotive and industrial
- **Moisture resistance** — Conformal coating and sealed assembly for IP-rated devices
- **Custom qualification testing** — Shock, vibration, humidity, and thermal cycling per your requirements

## Common Custom PMOLED Applications

**Fitness band display.** 0.87" white PMOLED + custom FPC for curved band routing + ultra-thin cover lens + IP67 sealed assembly. Optimized for 7-day battery life with activity tracking UI.

**Industrial sensor readout.** 1.3" yellow PMOLED + custom outline for legacy module replacement + extended temperature (-40°C to 80°C) + anti-glare cover glass. Drop-in upgrade for an existing instrument.

**Medical wearable.** 0.96" dual-color PMOLED (yellow header + white body) + biocompatible cover lens + custom FPC with medical-grade connector + low-power drive profile for continuous monitoring.

## PMOLED vs. AMOLED for Custom Projects

For displays under 2" with simple content (text, icons, status), custom PMOLED typically offers lower cost, simpler integration, and lower power than AMOLED. For larger displays, rich graphics, or full-color video, [custom AMOLED](/products/custom-displays/amoled) is the better choice. Our engineers will recommend the optimal technology based on your specific requirements.
