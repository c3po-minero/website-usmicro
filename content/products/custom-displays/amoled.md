# Custom AMOLED Displays

As the #1 provider of displays for the wearable market, US Micro Products has completed thousands of custom AMOLED display designs. Our engineering team transforms standard AMOLED panels into application-specific solutions through cover glass integration, touch sensor bonding, custom FPC design, and environmental hardening — giving your product the premium display experience that AMOLED technology delivers.

## AMOLED Customization Options

### Form Factor
- **Round displays** — Full-circle and flat-tire configurations from 1.19" to 1.6" for smartwatches and circular instruments
- **Rectangular displays** — Standard and custom aspect ratios from 0.95" to 6.67"
- **Flexible displays** — Curved and conformable panels on plastic substrates for wraparound wearable bands and non-planar designs

### Cover Lens & Glass
- **Chemically strengthened glass** — Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail for scratch and impact resistance
- **Sapphire crystal** — Maximum scratch resistance for luxury wearables
- **2.5D and 3D curved glass** — Wrapped-edge aesthetics matching modern consumer design language
- **Custom printing** — Bezels, graduation marks, logos on glass underside
- **Tinted and mirrored lenses** — Fashion-oriented cover treatments for consumer wearables

### Touch Integration
- **On-cell touch** — Sensor integrated into the AMOLED cell for minimum stack height
- **External PCAP overlay** — Separate touch sensor bonded to display for maximum flexibility
- **Glove mode** — Configurable sensitivity for medical and outdoor applications
- **Water/wet rejection** — Algorithms for fitness and marine environments

### Optical & Environmental
- **Full lamination (optical bonding)** — Eliminates air gap for improved outdoor readability and shock resistance
- **Anti-reflective and anti-fingerprint coatings** — Essential for wearable devices viewed in all lighting conditions
- **Extended temperature validation** — Testing and qualification to your specific environmental requirements
- **Waterproof integration** — Sealed assemblies for IP67/IP68-rated wearable devices

### Electrical
- **Custom FPC** — Modified length, width, routing, bend radius, and connector for your mechanical design
- **Interface adaptation** — MIPI DSI lane configuration, SPI mode selection
- **Integrated ambient light sensor** — Under-display ALS for automatic brightness control

## Typical Custom AMOLED Projects

**Smartwatch display.** 1.39" round AMOLED + 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass + on-cell PCAP touch + full lamination + custom FPC with ZIF connector + IP68-rated assembly. Designed for a wearable OEM requiring a premium display experience in a sealed, waterproof package.

**Medical wearable.** 1.2" round AMOLED + flat cover glass with antimicrobial coating + ultra-low power configuration + medical-grade biocompatible adhesives + custom FPC routing for wristband integration.

**Portable medical device.** 3.5" rectangular AMOLED + chemically strengthened cover glass + PCAP touch with glove mode + AR coating + extended temperature range (-10°C to 60°C).

## Why US Micro Products for Custom AMOLED

**Volume experience.** We've shipped millions of custom AMOLED displays for the wearable market. Our team has solved the hard problems — ultra-thin stack design, waterproof bonding, flexible FPC routing in tight enclosures, power optimization for all-day battery life.

**Panel access.** Direct relationships with tier-1 AMOLED panel manufacturers give us access to the latest technologies — high-PPI panels, flexible substrates, under-display sensors — before they're available through distribution.

**Full-stack capability.** We don't just supply panels — we engineer complete display assemblies including touch, cover glass, bonding, and cable design. One partner, one purchase order, one point of accountability.
