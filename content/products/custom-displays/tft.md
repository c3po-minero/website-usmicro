# Custom TFT Displays

US Micro Products' TFT LCD portfolio of 225+ standard modules serves as the foundation for custom engineering. Every panel in our [TFT catalog](/products/tft-displays) can be modified — from simple cover glass additions to comprehensive custom assemblies with optical bonding, interface conversion, extended temperature validation, and application-specific ruggedization.

## Customization Categories

### Optical Enhancements
- **High-brightness backlights** — Upgrade to 1,000, 1,500, or 2,000+ nit LED backlights for outdoor and sunlight-readable applications
- **Optical bonding** — Eliminate the air gap between cover glass and LCD. Improves contrast ratio by 400%+, reduces reflections, and significantly enhances shock and vibration resistance
- **Anti-reflective (AR) coatings** — Multi-layer dielectric coatings that reduce surface reflections from ~4% to <0.5% per surface
- **Anti-glare (AG) treatment** — Etched or coated surface to scatter specular reflections. Available in various haze levels
- **Polarizer modifications** — Custom polarizer angles, circular polarizer for NVIS compatibility, transflective polarizers for dual-mode operation

### Mechanical Customization
- **Cover glass** — Chemically strengthened (Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail, Xensation), custom thickness, custom shape, printed bezels, logos, and decorative elements
- **Custom FPC** — Modified flex cable length, routing path, connector type, and pin assignment to match your PCB layout
- **Custom outline dimensions** — Modified bezel width, mounting hole locations, and tab configurations
- **Housing integration** — Display pre-installed in custom metal or plastic bezels, brackets, or sub-frames

### Electrical Modifications
- **Interface conversion** — Add LVDS-to-HDMI, RGB-to-LVDS, or other interface adapter boards for system compatibility
- **Backlight driver** — Custom LED driver boards with specific dimming ranges, PWM frequencies, or constant-current configurations
- **EMI shielding** — Conductive coatings, wire mesh, and EMI gaskets for medical (IEC 60601) and military (MIL-STD-461) compliance
- **Touch integration** — Add PCAP touch overlay with controller board, bonded or air-gap mounted

### Environmental Modifications
- **Extended temperature** — Heater circuits for -40°C cold start, wide-temperature backlights, low-temp LC formulations
- **Conformal coating** — Protective coating on driver electronics for humidity, salt spray, and chemical resistance
- **Vibration and shock hardening** — Reinforced mounting, damped connections, bonded assemblies
- **IP-rated sealing** — Gasket design and integration for dust and water protection at the display level

## Common Custom TFT Applications

**Outdoor industrial display.** Standard 7" IPS TFT + 1,500 nit backlight + optical bonding + AR-coated cover glass + -40°C to 85°C temperature range. Result: a sunlight-readable panel that works year-round in exposed industrial environments.

**Medical patient monitor.** 10.1" IPS TFT + PCAP touch with glove mode + antimicrobial cover glass + IEC 60601 EMI compliance + optical bonding. Result: a touch display safe for clinical environments with cleaning-chemical resistance.

**Military vehicle display.** 8" TFT + NVIS-compatible polarizer + MIL-STD-810 vibration/shock rating + optical bonding + conformal coating + extended temperature. Result: a ruggedized display meeting defense requirements.

**Kiosk display.** 21.5" IPS TFT + PCAP touch + 6 mm chemically strengthened cover glass + anti-fingerprint coating + optical bonding + high brightness. Result: a vandal-resistant, always-on public-facing display.

## Process and Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Requirements review | 1 week | Specification document |
| Design & engineering | 2–4 weeks | Design package, BOM, drawings |
| Prototype build | 4–8 weeks | Working prototype units |
| Evaluation & iteration | 2–4 weeks | Test reports, design refinements |
| Production ramp | 4–6 weeks | Volume manufacturing |

Many catalog modifications (cover glass, bonding, FPC, backlight upgrade) can be prototyped in 4–6 weeks total.
