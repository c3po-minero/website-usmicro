# Open Frame Monitors

US Micro Products offers 20+ open frame monitor assemblies designed for integration into kiosks, gaming cabinets, POS terminals, digital signage enclosures, and industrial equipment. Open frame monitors arrive as complete, tested display assemblies — panel, driver board, power supply, and optional touch screen — without an external enclosure, ready to mount directly into your system's housing.

## What Is an Open Frame Monitor

An open frame monitor is a fully functional LCD display assembly without a consumer-style enclosure. It includes:

- **LCD panel** — TFT LCD in sizes from 7" to 55"+
- **Controller/driver board** — Accepts standard video inputs (HDMI, VGA, DVI, DisplayPort)
- **Power supply** — Internal or external, AC or DC input options
- **Mounting hardware** — VESA-compatible mounting holes, brackets, or flanges
- **Optional touch screen** — PCAP or resistive touch overlay with USB controller

The OEM integrator mounts the open frame monitor into their own enclosure, chassis, or panel cutout. This approach eliminates the cost and bulk of a consumer monitor enclosure while providing a display assembly that's pre-tested and ready for integration.

## Size Range

| Size Category | Diagonal Range | Typical Resolutions | Common Applications |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Small | 7" – 10.1" | 1024×600, 1280×800 | Instrument panels, compact kiosks |
| Medium | 15" – 21.5" | 1024×768, 1920×1080 | POS terminals, gaming machines, medical |
| Large | 23.8" – 32" | 1920×1080, 2560×1440 | Kiosks, digital signage, gaming |
| Extra Large | 42" – 55"+ | 1920×1080, 3840×2160 | Large-format kiosks, signage, gaming |

## Video Input Options

- **HDMI** — Standard for most modern systems. Carries video and audio over a single cable.
- **VGA** — Analog input for legacy system compatibility.
- **DVI** — Digital video for industrial and commercial systems.
- **DisplayPort** — High-bandwidth digital interface for high-resolution panels.
- **Composite/S-Video** — Available on select models for legacy integration.

## Touch Options

Open frame monitors are available with or without integrated touch:

- **Projected capacitive (PCAP)** — Multi-touch, durable, works through thick cover glass. Standard for new kiosk and POS designs. USB interface to host.
- **Resistive** — Single-touch, works with any pointing device (finger, glove, stylus). Lower cost. USB or serial interface.
- **No touch** — Display-only for signage, status displays, and non-interactive applications.

See our [touch panel page](/products/touch-panels) for detailed touch technology information.


## High-Brightness Options

For outdoor kiosks, drive-through displays, and sunlit industrial environments, we offer high-brightness open frame monitors with 1,000 to 2,500 nit LED backlights. Combined with anti-reflective cover glass and optical bonding, these displays remain readable in direct sunlight.

## Why Open Frame vs. Complete Monitors

| Factor | Open Frame | Enclosed Monitor |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Cost | Lower (no enclosure) | Higher |
| Weight | Lighter | Heavier |
| Flexibility | Fits your enclosure design | Fixed form factor |
| Customization | Easy to modify (brightness, touch, I/O) | Limited |
| Mounting | VESA or custom brackets | Stand or VESA only |
| IP rating | Determined by your enclosure | Fixed |
| Branding | Your brand, your design | Manufacturer's brand |

## Applications

- **[Kiosk & POS](/applications/kiosk-pos)** — Self-service terminals, ordering kiosks, check-in stations, ATMs
- **[Gaming](/applications/gaming)** — Slot machines, video poker, player tracking, sports betting terminals
- **[Industrial](/applications/industrial)** — Operator panels, SCADA displays, machine vision monitors
- **[Medical](/applications/medical)** — Bedside terminals, pharmacy dispensing, waiting room displays
- **[Instrumentation](/applications/instrumentation)** — Test station displays, data acquisition monitors

## Customization

- Custom brightness levels (standard through sunlight-readable)
- Touch integration (PCAP or resistive, bonded or air-gap)
- Custom cover glass with printing, coatings, and treatments
- Modified input configurations (add/remove video inputs)
- Custom cables and connectors
- Modified mounting solutions for non-VESA installations
