# Open Frame Monitors

US Micro Products offers 20+ open frame monitor assemblies designed for integration into kiosks, gaming cabinets, POS terminals, digital signage enclosures, and industrial equipment. Open frame monitors arrive as complete, tested display assemblies — panel, driver board, power supply, and optional touch screen — without an external enclosure, ready to mount directly into your system's housing.

## What Is an Open Frame Monitor

An open frame monitor is a fully functional LCD display assembly without a consumer-style enclosure. It includes:

- **LCD panel** — TFT LCD in sizes from 7" to 55"+
- **Controller/driver board** — Accepts standard video inputs (HDMI, VGA, DVI, DisplayPort)
- **Power supply** — Internal or external, AC or DC input options
- **Mounting hardware** — VESA-compatible mounting holes, brackets, or flanges
- **Optional touch screen** — PCAP or resistive touch overlay with USB controller

The OEM integrator mounts the open frame monitor into their own enclosure, chassis, or panel cutout. This approach eliminates the cost and bulk of a consumer monitor enclosure while providing a display assembly that's pre-tested and ready for integration.

## Touch Options

### Projected Capacitive (PCAP)
Multi-touch, durable, works through thick cover glass. Standard for new kiosk and POS designs. USB interface to host.

### Resistive Touch
Single-touch, works with any pointing device (finger, glove, stylus). Lower cost option. USB or serial interface.

### No Touch
Display-only for signage, status displays, and non-interactive applications.

## Video Input Options

- **HDMI** — Standard for most modern systems. Carries video and audio over a single cable.
- **VGA** — Analog input for legacy system compatibility.
- **DVI** — Digital video for industrial and commercial systems.
- **DisplayPort** — High-bandwidth digital interface for high-resolution panels.
- **Composite/S-Video** — Available on select models for legacy integration.

## Key Advantages

- **Sunlight-Readable Options:** High-brightness models with 1,000 to 2,500 nit LED backlights plus anti-reflective cover glass and optical bonding for full outdoor readability.
- **Lower Cost:** No enclosure means lower unit cost — you get a tested display assembly without paying for a consumer housing you'd remove anyway.
- **Design Freedom:** Mount into any enclosure, chassis, or panel cutout. Your housing, your brand, your form factor — no compromises.
- **Flexible Customization:** Easy to modify brightness, touch type, video inputs, cover glass, and mounting brackets to match your exact requirements.
- **Multiple Video Inputs:** HDMI, VGA, DVI, DisplayPort — connect to virtually any host system without adapters.
- **Production Ready:** Complete tested assemblies with panel, driver board, power supply, and optional touch. Integrate and ship.

## Applications

- **[Kiosk & POS](/applications/kiosk-pos)** — Self-service terminals, ordering kiosks, check-in stations, ATMs
- **[Gaming](/applications/gaming)** — Slot machines, video poker, player tracking, sports betting terminals
