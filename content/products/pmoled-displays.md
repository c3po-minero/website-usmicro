# PMOLED Displays

US Micro Products offers 36+ Passive-Matrix OLED (PMOLED) display modules optimized for applications where ultra-low power consumption, compact size, and excellent contrast are critical. PMOLED technology delivers the visual advantages of OLED — true blacks, wide viewing angles, and thin profiles — in a simpler, more cost-effective architecture suited to low-resolution, low-complexity display needs.

## PMOLED Technology Overview

PMOLED displays use a passive-matrix driving scheme where rows and columns of electrodes control pixel activation sequentially. Unlike AMOLED, which dedicates a transistor to each pixel, PMOLED shares drive circuitry across rows. This simplifies manufacturing and reduces cost for small displays with moderate resolution, but limits practical display sizes to approximately 3" diagonal and below.

The organic emissive layer produces light directly — no backlight is required. This means true black levels, wide viewing angles exceeding 170°, and a total module thickness as low as 1.4 mm. For engineers designing battery-powered products, PMOLED's ability to light only the active pixels translates to meaningful power savings over backlit LCD alternatives.

## When to Choose PMOLED

PMOLED is the optimal technology when your application meets these criteria:

- **Small display area** — Under 3" diagonal
- **Low to moderate resolution** — Typically up to 256×64 pixels
- **Simple content** — Text, icons, status indicators, basic graphics
- **Power budget constraints** — Battery-powered devices where every milliwatt matters
- **Contrast critical** — Applications requiring crisp text on true black backgrounds
- **Thin profile required** — Stack height under 2 mm
- **Cost sensitivity** — Lower cost than AMOLED for equivalent small sizes

## Available Configurations

| Parameter | Range |
|-----------|-------|
| Diagonal size | 0.49" – 2.7" |
| Resolution | 64×32 to 256×64 |
| Display colors | Monochrome (white, yellow, blue, green), dual-color, full-color (RGB) |
| Interface | SPI, I2C, Parallel |
| Operating temperature | -40°C to 80°C |
| Viewing angle | 170°+ |
| Thickness | 1.4 mm – 2.5 mm |

## Color Options

- **Monochrome white** — Highest brightness and longest lifespan. Best for general-purpose status displays.
- **Monochrome yellow** — High visibility for warning indicators and industrial readouts.
- **Monochrome blue** — Premium aesthetic for consumer electronics and wearable UI.
- **Monochrome green** — Classic instrumentation look, NVIS-compatible variants available.
- **Dual-color** — Two-zone color (e.g., yellow header + white body) for status differentiation without a full-color driver.
- **Full-color RGB** — 65K or 262K colors for graphics-capable applications.

## Customization

- Custom FPC length, routing, and connector type
- Cover glass with custom printing, AR coating, or protective lens
- Pin-compatible replacements for legacy OLED modules
- Extended temperature range validation
- Custom brightness levels and drive current optimization

## PMOLED vs. AMOLED: Choosing the Right OLED

| Factor | PMOLED | AMOLED |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Size range | Under 3" | 1" – 7"+ |
| Resolution | Low–moderate | Moderate–high |
| Content complexity | Text, icons, simple graphics | Full UI, video, rich graphics |
| Power (dark content) | Excellent | Excellent |
| Power (bright content) | Higher per pixel at large sizes | More efficient at scale |
| Cost (small sizes) | Lower | Higher |
| Thickness | Ultra-thin | Thin |
