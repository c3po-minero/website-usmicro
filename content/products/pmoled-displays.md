# PMOLED Displays

US Micro Products offers 36+ Passive-Matrix OLED (PMOLED) display modules optimized for applications where ultra-low power consumption, compact size, and excellent contrast are critical. PMOLED technology delivers the visual advantages of OLED — true blacks, wide viewing angles, and thin profiles — in a simpler, more cost-effective architecture suited to low-resolution, low-complexity display needs.

## PMOLED Technology Overview

PMOLED displays use a passive-matrix driving scheme where rows and columns of electrodes control pixel activation sequentially. Unlike AMOLED, which dedicates a transistor to each pixel, PMOLED shares drive circuitry across rows. This simplifies manufacturing and reduces cost for small displays with moderate resolution, but limits practical display sizes to approximately 3" diagonal and below.

The organic emissive layer produces light directly — no backlight is required. This means true black levels, wide viewing angles exceeding 170°, and a total module thickness as low as 1.4 mm. For engineers designing battery-powered products, PMOLED's ability to light only the active pixels translates to meaningful power savings over backlit LCD alternatives.

## When to Choose PMOLED

PMOLED is the right technology when your design calls for a compact, power-efficient display with straightforward content requirements. Here's how to decide:

**Display size under 3 inches.** PMOLED excels in small form factors — from 0.42" micro-displays to 2.7" readout panels. The passive-matrix architecture keeps costs low at these sizes while delivering OLED visual quality that LCD can't match.

**Simple, high-contrast content.** Text readouts, status icons, progress bars, and basic animations look stunning on PMOLED. The true black background makes every pixel pop, whether it's a heart rate number on a fitness band or a temperature reading on a thermostat.

**Every milliwatt counts.** In battery-powered designs, PMOLED shines — literally only the active pixels consume power. A status display showing white text on black uses a fraction of the energy of a backlit LCD equivalent. Stack heights under 2mm are achievable.

**Budget-conscious OLED.** Need OLED quality without AMOLED pricing? PMOLED delivers the same true blacks, wide viewing angles, and thin profiles at a fraction of the cost for small display sizes.

## Color Options

- **Monochrome white** — Highest brightness and longest lifespan. Best for general-purpose status displays.
- **Monochrome yellow** — High visibility for warning indicators and industrial readouts.
- **Monochrome blue** — Premium aesthetic for consumer electronics and wearable UI.
- **Monochrome green** — Classic instrumentation look, NVIS-compatible variants available.
- **Dual-color** — Two-zone color (e.g., yellow header + white body) for status differentiation without a full-color driver.
- **Full-color RGB** — 65K or 262K colors for graphics-capable applications.

## Customization

- Custom FPC length, routing, and connector type
- Cover glass with custom printing, AR coating, or protective lens
- Pin-compatible replacements for legacy OLED modules

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the maximum resolution for PMOLED displays?
PMOLED displays typically max out at 256×64 pixels. The passive-matrix architecture limits practical resolution because higher pixel counts require faster multiplexing, which reduces brightness and increases power consumption. For higher resolution OLED needs, consider our [AMOLED displays](/products/amoled-displays).

### How long do PMOLED displays last?
PMOLED displays are rated for 15,000–30,000 hours at typical brightness. Lifespan depends on brightness level, duty cycle, and content pattern. Monochrome white offers the longest lifespan, while blue subpixels degrade faster. Our engineering team can optimize drive parameters for your specific longevity requirements.

### Can PMOLED displays operate in extreme temperatures?
Many of our PMOLED modules are rated for -40°C to 80°C operating range. For extended temperature applications, we offer custom validation and drive optimization to ensure reliable operation across your full environmental envelope.

### What interfaces are available for PMOLED?
Most PMOLED modules support I2C or SPI, making them easy to integrate with common microcontrollers like STM32, ESP32, and Nordic nRF series. Some larger modules also support parallel interfaces for higher data throughput.
