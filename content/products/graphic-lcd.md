# Graphic LCD Displays

US Micro Products offers 20+ monochrome graphic LCD modules for applications requiring custom graphics, waveforms, bar charts, multi-language text, or any visual content beyond the fixed character sets of [character LCD modules](/products/character-lcd). Graphic LCDs combine the low power, wide temperature range, and reliability of passive-matrix LCD technology with full pixel-level control.

## Technology Overview

Graphic LCD modules provide a pixel-addressable display area where each individual pixel can be turned on or off independently. Unlike character LCDs with fixed character cells, graphic LCDs accept arbitrary bitmap data, enabling custom fonts, icons, logos, waveform displays, and graphical user interfaces in a monochrome format.

The display glass uses passive-matrix LCD technology — either STN (Super-Twisted Nematic) or FSTN (Film-compensated STN) — driven by a dedicated controller IC. Common controllers include the ST7920, UC1701, SSD1306, and T6963C, each offering different resolution support and interface options.

## LCD Panel Types

### STN (Super-Twisted Nematic)
STN panels use a 180-270° twist angle to achieve higher contrast and wider viewing angles than standard TN. Available in yellow-green (positive mode) and blue (negative mode). Cost-effective choice for most industrial and instrumentation applications.

### FSTN (Film-Compensated STN)
FSTN adds a retardation film to the STN panel to eliminate the color tint, producing a clean black-on-white (positive) or white-on-black (negative) appearance. Preferred for medical devices, high-readability instruments, and applications where neutral color rendering matters.

## Package Types

### COG (Chip-on-Glass)
The driver IC is bonded directly to the LCD glass substrate, eliminating the need for a separate PCB. COG modules are thinner, lighter, and more compact — ideal for portable devices and space-constrained designs. The trade-off is a more delicate flex cable connection.

### COB (Chip-on-Board)
The driver IC is mounted on a PCB that is then connected to the LCD glass. COB modules are more mechanically robust and easier to handle during assembly. Suited for industrial equipment where ruggedness takes priority over profile.

### TAB (Tape Automated Bonding)
The driver IC is mounted on a flex cable connecting the glass to the interface. A middle ground between COG and COB in terms of thickness and mechanical robustness.

## Common Resolutions

| Resolution | Typical Size | Common Applications |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 128 × 32 | 2.2" | Status bars, simple readouts |
| 128 × 64 | 2.4" – 3.1" | Instruments, portable devices |
| 160 × 128 | 2.8" | Enhanced graphics, menus |
| 240 × 128 | 4.0" – 5.0" | Data-dense instrumentation |
| 320 × 240 | 5.7" | Industrial HMI, medical panels |

## Interface Options

- **SPI** — Minimal pin count serial interface. Fastest integration with modern microcontrollers.
- **I2C** — Two-wire serial bus. Share the bus with other peripherals.
- **Parallel 8-bit** — Maximum data throughput for fast screen updates. HD44780-style pinout on some models.

## Key Advantages

**Full pixel control.** Display anything — custom fonts, multi-language text (including CJK characters), scientific notation, bar charts, waveforms, icons, logos, and graphical menus.

**Low power.** Passive-matrix LCD with reflective or transflective operation can run on microamps in static display mode. Even with LED backlighting, total power is typically under 30 mA.

**Sunlight readability.** Reflective and transflective modes become more readable in bright ambient light — the opposite of emissive displays. No backlight needed for outdoor visibility.

**Wide operating temperature.** Standard -20°C to 70°C; extended -40°C to 85°C available for automotive, military, and industrial environments.

## Customization

- Custom outline dimensions for drop-in replacement of legacy modules
- Custom backlight color and brightness
- Optical bonding for enhanced contrast and ruggedness
- Custom cover glass with printing, AR coating, or EMI shielding
- Extended temperature range validation
- Custom FPC, connector, and pin assignment

## Applications

- **[Instrumentation](/applications/instrumentation)** — Oscilloscope displays, multimeter readouts, spectrum analyzers
- **[Industrial](/applications/industrial)** — Process controllers, programmable logic displays, equipment panels
- **[Medical](/applications/medical)** — Infusion pump interfaces, diagnostic equipment readouts
- **[Consumer](/applications/consumer)** — Audio equipment, 3D printer interfaces, appliance controls
