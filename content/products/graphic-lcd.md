# Graphic LCD Displays

US Micro Products offers 20+ monochrome graphic LCD modules for applications requiring custom graphics, waveforms, bar charts, multi-language text, or any visual content beyond the fixed character sets of [character LCD modules](/products/character-lcd). Graphic LCDs combine the low power, wide temperature range, and reliability of passive-matrix LCD technology with full pixel-level control.

## Technology Overview

Graphic LCD modules provide a pixel-addressable display area where each individual pixel can be turned on or off independently. Unlike character LCDs with fixed character cells, graphic LCDs accept arbitrary bitmap data, enabling custom fonts, icons, logos, waveform displays, and graphical user interfaces in a monochrome format.

The display glass uses passive-matrix LCD technology — either STN (Super-Twisted Nematic) or FSTN (Film-compensated STN) — driven by a dedicated controller IC. Common controllers include the ST7920, UC1701, SSD1306, and T6963C, each offering different resolution support and interface options.

## Package Types

### COG (Chip-on-Glass)
Driver IC bonded directly to the LCD glass — thinner, lighter, more compact. Ideal for portable devices and space-constrained designs. Delicate flex cable connection requires careful handling during assembly.

### COB (Chip-on-Board)
Driver IC mounted on a PCB connected to the LCD glass. Mechanically robust and easy to handle during assembly. Best for industrial equipment where ruggedness matters more than thin profile.

### TAB (Tape Automated Bonding)
Driver IC mounted on a flex cable between glass and interface board. Balances COG thinness with COB robustness — good middle-ground for many designs.

## Interface Options

- **SPI** — Minimal pin count serial interface. Fastest integration with modern microcontrollers.
- **I2C** — Two-wire serial bus. Share the bus with other peripherals.
- **Parallel 8-bit** — Maximum data throughput for fast screen updates. HD44780-style pinout on some models.

## Key Advantages

- **Full Pixel Control:** Display anything — custom fonts, CJK characters, scientific notation, bar charts, waveforms, icons, logos, and graphical menus. No character ROM limitations.
- **Ultra-Low Power:** Passive-matrix LCD with reflective mode runs on microamps in static display. Even with LED backlighting, total power stays under 30 mA.
- **Sunlight Readable:** Reflective and transflective modes get more readable in bright light — the opposite of emissive displays. No backlight needed outdoors.
- **Wide Temperature Range:** Standard -20°C to 70°C; extended -40°C to 85°C for automotive, military, and harsh industrial environments.
- **Proven & Reliable:** Decades of volume production with extremely low failure rates and stable global supply chain.
- **Cost-Effective:** Significantly cheaper than TFT for monochrome applications while offering full graphical capability.

## Customization

- Custom outline dimensions for drop-in replacement of legacy modules
- Custom backlight color and brightness
- Optical bonding for enhanced contrast and ruggedness
- Custom cover glass with printing, AR coating, or EMI shielding
- Extended temperature range validation
- Custom FPC, connector, and pin assignment

## Applications

- **[Instrumentation](/applications/instrumentation)** — Oscilloscope displays, multimeter readouts, spectrum analyzers, signal generators
- **[Industrial](/applications/industrial)** — Process controllers, programmable logic displays, equipment panels, CNC interfaces
- **[Medical](/applications/medical)** — Infusion pump interfaces, diagnostic equipment readouts, patient monitoring accessories
- **[Consumer](/applications/consumer)** — Audio equipment, 3D printer interfaces, appliance controls, smart home panels
