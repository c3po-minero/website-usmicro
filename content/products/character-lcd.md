# Character LCD Displays

US Micro Products offers 45+ character LCD display modules for applications requiring reliable alphanumeric text readout without the complexity or cost of a graphic display. Character LCDs remain the most cost-effective and power-efficient solution for industrial controls, instrumentation, HVAC systems, and any application where text-based status information is the primary display requirement.

## Technology Overview

Character LCD modules combine a passive-matrix LCD glass panel with an integrated controller/driver IC (typically HD44780-compatible) that manages character generation from a built-in ROM. Engineers specify text content by sending ASCII codes over a simple parallel or I2C interface — no frame buffer, no graphics driver, no display-specific firmware development.

The display is organized in rows and columns of fixed character cells, each typically 5×8 pixels. Standard configurations include 8×1, 8×2, 16×1, 16×2, 16×4, 20×2, 20×4, 24×2, and 40×4 — with 16×2 and 20×4 being the most commonly specified.

## Interface Options

- **Parallel 4-bit/8-bit (6800)** — Standard HD44780 interface. Maximum compatibility with microcontrollers and legacy systems.
- **I2C** — Two-wire serial interface via I/O expander. Reduces pin count for GPIO-constrained microcontrollers.
- **SPI** — Available on select modules for higher-speed serial communication.

## Backlight Options

- **LED (white, yellow-green, blue, red, amber)** — Most common. Long life, low power, uniform illumination.
- **No backlight** — Reflective or transflective operation for sunlight-readable applications and maximum power savings.
- **Negative mode (light text on dark background)** — Blue or black background with white text. Premium appearance for consumer and medical equipment.

## Key Advantages

- **Dead-Simple Integration:** Send an ASCII code, get a character. No frame buffer, no GPU, no display driver stack — firmware development in minutes, not days.
- **Ultra-Low Power:** Reflective character LCDs draw as little as 1-2 mA without backlight. Even with LED backlighting, total consumption stays under 50 mA.
- **Extreme Temperature Range:** Standard modules operate -20°C to 70°C. Extended versions rated -40°C to 85°C for outdoor, automotive, and harsh industrial environments.
- **Proven Reliability:** Over 40 years of volume production. Extremely low failure rates and rock-solid supply chain stability.
- **Lowest Cost Per Unit:** The most cost-effective display technology available — ideal for high-volume, price-sensitive applications.
- **Universal Compatibility:** HD44780-compatible interface works with virtually every microcontroller platform from Arduino to STM32.

## Customization

- Custom backlight colors and brightness levels
- Extended temperature validation and certification
- Custom character sets (CGRAM programming or custom ROM)
- Custom FPC, connector, and pin assignments
- Custom outline dimensions for drop-in replacements
- Optical filters for contrast enhancement or EMI shielding

## Applications

- **[Industrial](/applications/industrial)** — PLC readouts, motor controllers, HVAC panels, factory automation equipment, process control displays
- **[Instrumentation](/applications/instrumentation)** — Multimeters, power supplies, bench equipment, frequency counters, signal generators
- **[Medical](/applications/medical)** — Device status panels, calibration readouts, infusion pump displays, patient monitoring accessories
- **[Consumer](/applications/consumer)** — Appliance controls, audio equipment, hobbyist platforms, vending machines, point-of-sale terminals
