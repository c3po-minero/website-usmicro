# TFT LCD Displays

US Micro Products offers over 225 TFT LCD display modules spanning 0.96" to 84" diagonal, covering IPS, TN, and MVA panel types with every major interface standard. Whether your application requires a compact wearable screen or a large-format industrial monitor, our TFT lineup provides the performance and flexibility OEM engineers demand.

## TFT Display Technology Overview

Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) LCD technology remains the most widely deployed active-matrix display platform in the industry. Each pixel is driven by its own transistor, enabling fast response times, high color fidelity, and full grayscale control. Unlike passive-matrix LCDs, TFT displays can achieve the contrast ratios, refresh rates, and viewing angles required by modern industrial, medical, and commercial applications.

US Micro Products sources TFT modules from established panel manufacturers and applies our engineering expertise to customize them for your specific application — modifying interfaces, backlights, FPC connectors, cover glass, optical bonding, and environmental ratings as needed.

## Panel Types Available

### IPS (In-Plane Switching)
The gold standard for applications requiring wide viewing angles (typically 170°/170° or better) and accurate color reproduction. IPS panels maintain consistent color and contrast when viewed from off-axis positions, making them essential for medical imaging, multi-operator industrial systems, and any application where the display is viewed from varying positions. Our IPS TFT modules range from small wearable sizes through large-format panels.

### TN (Twisted Nematic)
TN panels offer the fastest response times and lowest cost per unit area. While viewing angles are narrower than IPS, TN displays excel in single-operator, head-on applications like instrumentation readouts, single-user terminals, and cost-sensitive consumer devices. Their high switching speed also suits applications with rapidly updating data.

### MVA (Multi-Domain Vertical Alignment)
MVA panels deliver a balance between IPS and TN — wider viewing angles than TN, deeper blacks than IPS, and strong contrast ratios (often 3000:1 or higher). MVA is particularly effective in high-contrast applications such as automotive dashboards, medical monitors, and outdoor displays where deep blacks improve readability.

## Interface Options

Our TFT displays support all major interface standards, selected based on resolution, data rate, cable length, and your system's processing capabilities:

- **SPI** — Simple serial interface for small, low-resolution displays. Minimal pin count, ideal for microcontroller-driven applications.
- **RGB (Parallel)** — Direct pixel-clock interface providing high bandwidth for displays up to ~1024×600. Common in embedded systems with dedicated LCD controllers.
- **LVDS** — Low-Voltage Differential Signaling for medium to large panels. Excellent noise immunity over longer cable runs. Standard in industrial and medical equipment.
- **MIPI DSI** — Mobile Industry Processor Interface. High-bandwidth serial link standard in mobile processors and modern SoCs. Available in 1, 2, or 4 lane configurations.
- **eDP** — Embedded DisplayPort for high-resolution panels (Full HD and above). Common in tablet-sized and larger displays driven by application processors.


## Customization Options

Every TFT display in our catalog can serve as a starting point for customization. Common modifications include:

- **Brightness enhancement** — High-brightness LED backlights for outdoor and sunlight-readable applications (1,000+ nits)
- **Optical bonding** — Eliminate the air gap between cover glass and LCD to improve contrast, reduce reflections, and enhance shock resistance
- **Custom cover glass** — Chemically strengthened glass, anti-glare coatings, anti-fingerprint treatments, custom printing, and bezels
- **Extended temperature range** — Heater circuits and wide-temp backlights for -40°C to +85°C operation
- **Interface conversion** — Modify or add interface boards to match your system requirements
- **Custom FPC/connector** — Tailored flex cables and connector types for your mechanical design
- **EMI shielding** — Conductive coatings and gaskets for sensitive military and medical environments

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between IPS and TN TFT displays?
IPS panels provide wide viewing angles (170°+ in all directions) and accurate color reproduction, making them ideal for multi-viewer or critical-color applications. TN panels have faster response times and lower cost but narrower viewing angles (typically 60-70° off-axis). Choose IPS for medical, automotive, and industrial HMI; TN for single-operator instrumentation and cost-sensitive designs.

### What interface should I use for my TFT display?
Interface selection depends on resolution, update rate, cable length, and your processor. SPI suits small displays under 320×240. RGB parallel works well up to 1024×600 with dedicated LCD controllers. LVDS is standard for 7"+ industrial panels. MIPI DSI matches modern ARM SoCs. eDP handles Full HD and above. Our engineers can recommend the optimal interface for your system architecture.

### Can I get a TFT display with a custom brightness level?
Yes. We routinely modify backlight assemblies to achieve brightness from 300 nits (indoor) to 1,500+ nits (direct sunlight readability). Custom brightness levels do not typically require tooling charges.

### What is the lead time for standard vs. custom TFT displays?
Standard products from inventory ship in 1-2 weeks. Custom modifications typically require 8-12 weeks depending on complexity. Contact our team for a specific timeline based on your requirements.

### Do you offer sunlight-readable TFT displays?
Yes. We offer high-brightness TFT modules (1,000+ nits) combined with optical bonding and anti-reflective coatings for full sunlight readability. See our [harsh environments](/applications/harsh-environments) page for details.
