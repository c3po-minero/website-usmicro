# Custom Tablets

US Micro Products designs and manufactures custom tablet solutions for OEMs whose applications demand more than consumer-grade hardware. Our tablets are purpose-built for industrial, medical, and field service environments where ruggedness, custom I/O, specific OS configurations, and branded enclosures are essential requirements — not afterthoughts.

## Why Custom Tablets

Consumer tablets compromise on environmental durability, lack specialized I/O, run consumer operating systems with unwanted features, and carry another company's brand. When your product's reputation depends on the tablet's reliability, a consumer device adapted with a case and custom app is not a viable long-term solution.

Our custom tablet platform addresses what commercial tablets cannot:

**Rugged mechanical design.** Impact, vibration, and drop specifications rated to your application's requirements. IP-rated sealing against dust, water, and chemical splash. Operating temperature ranges from -20°C to 60°C.

**Custom I/O.** Barcode scanners, RFID/NFC readers, specialized serial ports (RS-232, RS-485), GPIO, custom USB configurations, SIM card slots, external antenna ports, and docking connectors designed for your workflow.

**OS and software control.** Locked-down Android builds, custom Linux distributions, or Windows IoT configurations. No unwanted apps, no user-initiated updates, no consumer services interfering with your application.

**Your brand.** Custom enclosure design, branded boot screens, your logo, your colors. The tablet is your product, not a generic device in a case.

**Lifecycle commitment.** Consumer tablets are discontinued without warning. Our custom tablets are supported for 5–7+ year production lifecycles with managed component changes and EOL planning.

## Customization Options

- Custom enclosure design (colors, materials, form factor)
- Peripheral integration (barcode, RFID, fingerprint, camera)
- Custom I/O and connector configurations

## Our Process

Custom tablet development follows our Engineering Display Solution Process (EDSP):

- **Requirements Definition:** We work with your engineering team to document display, mechanical, electrical, environmental, and software requirements.
- **Concept Design:** Industrial design concepts, I/O planning, component selection.
- **Prototype:** Working prototype units for your evaluation and application testing.
- **Validation:** Environmental, reliability, and compliance testing.
- **Production:** Volume manufacturing with ongoing quality management and supply chain support.

Typical development timeline: 16–24 weeks from requirements lock to production-ready units.
