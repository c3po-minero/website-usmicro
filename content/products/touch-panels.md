# Touch Panels

US Micro Products offers 24+ capacitive touch panel solutions — standalone touch sensors and integrated touch-display assemblies for medical, industrial, kiosk, military, and consumer applications. Our touch panel portfolio focuses on projected capacitive (PCAP) technology, the industry standard for multi-touch, durability, and environmental resilience.

## Projected Capacitive Touch Technology

Projected capacitive (PCAP) touch panels detect finger position by measuring changes in capacitance across a grid of transparent conductive traces (typically ITO — Indium Tin Oxide) deposited on glass or film substrates. Unlike resistive touch screens that require physical deflection, PCAP panels detect proximity through cover glass up to 8 mm thick, enabling sealed, flush-surface designs with no moving parts.

PCAP technology supports true multi-touch (10+ simultaneous touch points), enabling pinch-zoom, rotation, and multi-finger gestures. The sensor surface has no wear-prone layers, resulting in virtually unlimited touch life.

## Touch Panel Configurations

### Standalone Touch Sensors
Separate PCAP sensor panels designed to be optically bonded or air-gap mounted over an existing display. Available as glass-glass (GG), glass-film (GF), or glass-film-film (GFF) stack-ups. The standalone approach allows maximum flexibility in display selection.

### Touch-Display Assemblies
Pre-bonded touch panel + display combinations where the touch sensor is optically laminated to the LCD or OLED panel. Eliminates the air gap, reducing reflections by up to 80% and improving outdoor readability, shock resistance, and overall module thickness.

### On-Cell Touch
For select AMOLED and TFT displays, the touch sensor is integrated directly into the display cell structure, eliminating the separate touch panel layer entirely. The thinnest possible touch-enabled display stack.

## Sensor Stack-Up Options

| Stack-Up | Structure | Advantages | Trade-offs |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| GG (Glass-Glass) | Cover glass + sensor glass | Highest durability, best optical clarity | Thicker, heavier |
| GF (Glass-Film) | Cover glass + sensor film | Thinner than GG, good durability | Slightly less rigid |
| GFF (Glass-Film-Film) | Cover glass + two sensor films | Cost-effective multi-touch | Lower optical clarity |
| OGS (One Glass Solution) | Sensor on inner surface of cover glass | Thinnest, lightest | Less customizable |

## Advanced Touch Capabilities

### Glove Mode
Modified sensitivity profiles that detect touches through latex, nitrile, surgical, or insulated work gloves up to 3 mm thick. Critical for [medical](/applications/medical), [military](/applications/military), and [industrial](/applications/industrial) applications where bare-finger operation is impractical.

### Wet-Finger and Water Rejection
Algorithms that distinguish between water droplets/films and intentional finger touches. Essential for [marine](/applications/marine), outdoor, and medical environments where the display surface may be wet.

### Proximity Sensing
Detection of finger approach before physical contact, enabling hover effects and wake-from-sleep functionality. Reduces power consumption in battery-operated devices.

### Palm Rejection
Algorithms that ignore large-area, unintentional touches (resting palms, cleaning cloths) while responding to fingertip inputs.

## Cover Glass Options

The cover glass is both the user's touch surface and the display's primary protection. We offer:

- **Chemically strengthened glass** — Corning Gorilla Glass, AGC Dragontrail, Schott Xensation
- **Anti-glare (AG)** treatment — Etched or coated surface to reduce specular reflections
- **Anti-reflective (AR)** coating — Multi-layer optical coating for maximum light transmission
- **Anti-fingerprint (AF)** oleophobic coating — Reduces smudge visibility and eases cleaning
- **Anti-microbial** coatings — Silver ion or copper-based surface treatment for medical and public-facing applications
- **Custom printing** — Bezels, logos, icons, and decorative elements silk-screened on the glass underside
- **Custom shapes** — Cutouts, holes, curved edges, notches for buttons or sensors

## Applications

- **[Medical](/applications/medical)** — Surgical displays, patient monitors, diagnostic equipment (glove mode, antimicrobial)
- **[Industrial](/applications/industrial)** — HMI panels, factory automation, CNC controls (glove mode, rugged cover glass)
- **[Kiosk & POS](/applications/kiosk-pos)** — Self-service terminals, ATMs, wayfinding (vandal-resistant, anti-microbial)
- **[Military](/applications/military)** — Rugged field terminals, vehicle-mounted displays (glove mode, MIL-STD)
- **[Gaming](/applications/gaming)** — Casino terminals, interactive displays (high-durability, 24/7 operation)
- **[Marine](/applications/marine)** — Chartplotters, vessel controls (wet-finger, sunlight readable)
- **[Automotive](/applications/automotive)** — Center stack, HVAC controls (glove mode, vibration resistant)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between capacitive and resistive touch screens?
Capacitive (PCAP) touch detects changes in capacitance from finger proximity and requires no physical pressure. It supports multi-touch, has no wear-prone layers, and works through thick cover glass. Resistive touch requires physical deflection of a flexible top layer, supports only single-touch, and has limited lifespan due to mechanical wear. PCAP is the industry standard for new designs; resistive is used only in specific legacy or stylus-required applications.

### Can capacitive touch work with gloves?
Yes. Our touch controllers support configurable sensitivity modes for use with surgical gloves (0.1 mm), nitrile gloves (0.5 mm), and insulated work gloves (up to 3 mm). Glove mode can be activated automatically or via command from the host system.

### What cover glass thickness do you recommend?
For consumer devices, 0.7–1.1 mm is typical. Industrial HMI applications commonly use 1.8–3.0 mm for impact resistance. Vandal-resistant kiosk and public-access applications may specify 4–6 mm. The thicker the glass, the more the touch sensitivity algorithm must compensate — our controllers support glass up to 8 mm.
